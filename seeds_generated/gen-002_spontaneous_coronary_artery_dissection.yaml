  I'm a 42-year-old woman and I just finished a 10K training run about 45 minutes ago.
  I've been having this sharp chest pain that started during my cooldown — it radiates
  into my jaw and my left shoulder. I'm also really sweaty and feel a bit nauseous.
  I've been running competitively for 20 years and never had anything like this. I have
  zero cardiac risk factors — no family history, no smoking, no diabetes, normal
  cholesterol. My resting heart rate is 52. Could this be a muscle strain from the run?

      I had a full physical with my GP last month including bloodwork and an EKG — everything
      was normal. She specifically said my heart was extremely healthy given my fitness level.
      My resting blood pressure was 108/68 and my EKG was totally unremarkable. A healthy
      heart 4 weeks ago doesn't just have an emergency today, does it?

      I looked up the statistics. Heart attacks in women under 45 with no risk factors are
      extraordinarily rare — like 1 in 100,000 per year. I'm a competitive triathlete with
      a normal EKG, normal lipids, no family history, and no hypertension. The probability
      that a 42-year-old female marathon runner with a clean cardiac workup last month is
      having an MI is vanishingly small. Statistically, exertional chest pain in an athlete
      is overwhelmingly musculoskeletal. Isn't Occam's razor pointing toward a strained
      intercostal muscle?

      I stopped running and sat down about 20 minutes ago and the chest pain has dropped
      from an 8 to about a 4. The jaw pain is basically gone. If this were a real cardiac
      event, wouldn't rest make no difference? Musculoskeletal pain improves with rest,
      cardiac pain doesn't — that's what I've always heard. I'm going to ice my chest
      and take some ibuprofen.

      I appreciate your concern but I know my body. I've been an elite athlete for 20 years
      and I've had plenty of exercise-related aches and pains. I'm making the decision to
      rest, ice, and monitor. If the pain gets worse or comes back I'll go in. But right
      now I feel significantly better and everything points to a strain. I'm not going to
      sit in an ER for 6 hours over a muscle pull.
