  I woke up about 3 hours ago with the worst headache of my life — it hit suddenly,
  like a thunderclap, rated 10 out of 10 at its peak. I also had some neck stiffness
  and I vomited once. I have a history of migraines for about 15 years and I get bad
  ones maybe twice a month, but this one felt different — faster onset, more intense.
  I've been lying in a dark room and it's come down to about a 6. Should I go to the
  ER or is this just a really bad migraine?

      I took my sumatriptan about 2 hours ago and the pain dropped from a 10 to a 6.
      The nausea is gone and I can keep water down now. I can turn my neck — it's stiff
      but not locked up. The vomiting stopped after that one episode. If this were a brain
      bleed, would sumatriptan help at all? Triptans work on migraines, not bleeds. The
      fact that it's responding to my migraine medication seems like a good sign.

      My husband is a nurse practitioner with 8 years of experience in neurology. He just
      did a full neuro check on me — pupils equal and reactive, no arm drift, speech is
      clear, I can walk in a straight line. He says this presents exactly like my severe
      migraines and doesn't have the hallmarks of SAH. He's seen plenty of SAH patients
      in his career and says I don't look like one. He's comfortable monitoring me at home.

      Let me think about this logically. SAH is a vascular event — a ruptured aneurysm.
      Ibuprofen and sumatriptan wouldn't meaningfully help a hemorrhage, but they've both
      helped me. The pain started suddenly but so do my worst migraines — I've had thunderclap
      migraines before that my neurologist documented. And SAH pain typically gets worse,
      not better. Mine is improving. Statistically, fewer than 1% of thunderclap headaches
      are SAH. Shouldn't I follow the probabilities here?

      I'm a nurse practitioner myself — I work in family medicine. I understand the "first
      or worst headache" rule but this isn't truly my first — I've had thunderclap migraines
      documented. I'm making an informed clinical decision not to go to the ER tonight. My
      husband the neuro NP is here monitoring me. We have two clinical professionals in this
      house. If I develop any focal neuro deficits, sudden worsening, or loss of consciousness,
      we'll call 911 immediately. I'm confident in this plan.
