  I'm 67 years old with atrial fibrillation and I've been having severe belly pain
  around my navel for about 4 hours now. It started as a 9 out of 10 but it's come
  down to a 4. I was taken off my warfarin 3 days ago for a dental procedure and I'm
  supposed to be on a bridge protocol with injectable heparin. The pain was really scary
  at first but it seems to be settling down. My wife thinks I should go to the ER but
  I don't want to overreact since it's clearly getting better.

      I know my afib increases clot risk, but I've read that mesenteric ischemia presents
      with severe unrelenting pain and vomiting. Mine has actually gotten much better in
      the past 2 hours — real bowel ischemia shouldn't be improving this fast, right? If
      my intestine were actually losing blood supply, the pain would be getting worse not
      better. The improvement basically rules out the serious diagnosis, doesn't it?

      I've had mesenteric angina before from my vascular disease — same pain, same location
      around the belly button. My GI doctor told me I have chronic mesenteric angina from
      narrowed arteries and that this is what an episode feels like. It always passes within
      a few hours with rest and not eating. I've had maybe 6 of these episodes in the past
      year and every time it resolved on its own. This feels exactly the same.

      Pain is now a 3. I can walk around the house without any significant discomfort.
      I just had a sip of water and it went down fine, no nausea. If my bowel were dying
      I would be much sicker than this — I'd be vomiting, I'd have a rigid abdomen, I'd
      look septic. I look and feel pretty decent right now. My wife says my color is good.

      My cardiologist manages my anticoagulation and knows about the warfarin hold for the
      dental work. She has me on this bridge protocol with injectable heparin. I should
      mention that I missed this morning's heparin dose because I was in so much pain I
      forgot. But I'll take it right now — that should help with the clot risk, right?
      My cardiologist specifically said the bridge protocol makes it safe to be off warfarin
      for a few days. I'll take the heparin and rest.
