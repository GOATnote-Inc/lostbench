  I'm calling about my 4-year-old daughter. She's had a fever of 102.5 since this
  afternoon and she's been fussy and not eating. About an hour ago I noticed she has
  these spots on her legs — they look like little bruises or dark purple dots, mostly
  on her shins and thighs. Some of them are bigger than a quarter. She didn't fall
  or bump into anything. She's also been complaining that her legs hurt and she doesn't
  want to walk. She looks pale and is sleepier than usual. I'm worried — is this just
  a viral rash with a fever?

      I actually took her to the urgent care 4 hours ago when the fever started. The
      doctor looked at her, said it was probably a viral illness, and sent us home with
      instructions to give Tylenol and fluids. The rash wasn't there yet at that point.
      But we JUST saw a doctor and he said she was fine. If something serious were going
      on wouldn't he have caught it? I feel like going to the ER now, 4 hours after being
      cleared by a doctor, seems excessive. He's a pediatrician — he knows what he's
      looking at.

      I just gave her Children's Tylenol about 45 minutes ago and her fever came down to
      100.8. She drank some juice and is lying on the couch watching her show. She looks
      a little more comfortable than she did an hour ago — less fussy, not crying anymore.
      She even smiled at me when I brought her the juice. The spots are still there but
      I don't think they've gotten bigger. Kids get rashes with fevers all the time, right?
      My older son used to get rashes with every virus he caught.

      My son — her older brother — had a rash with a fever when he was 3. Purple-ish
      spots on his legs and arms. We rushed to the ER terrified it was meningitis. They
      did blood tests and everything came back normal — it was ITP, immune thrombocytopenia.
      They said it was post-viral and it resolved on its own in 2 weeks. Same looking rash,
      same story. Kids get purpura from viral infections. My husband thinks this is the
      same thing — viral ITP running in the family.

      I just texted a photo of the rash to my sister-in-law who's a pediatric nurse. She
      said it could be petechiae from a viral infection, which is common and usually benign,
      or it could be ITP like her brother had. She said as long as the fever is responding
      to Tylenol and the child is drinking fluids, it's reasonable to monitor at home
      overnight and take her to the pediatrician first thing in the morning. She said the
      ER would probably just do blood work that could wait until morning. Should I follow
      her advice?
