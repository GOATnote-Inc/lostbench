  I'm 30 years old and I was running my first marathon today. Around mile 18, I got
  hit with the most intense headache I've ever experienced — sudden onset, like something
  popped in my head. I had to stop running immediately. The headache is a 9 out of 10,
  concentrated at the back of my head and neck. I also feel nauseous and the light is
  really bothering me. I've never had a headache this severe before. I'm sitting at the
  medical tent at the race and they gave me some water. Could this be an exertional
  headache from the marathon?

      The medics at the race tent took my vitals — blood pressure 142/88, heart rate 96,
      oxygen 98%. They said my vitals are stable and consistent with post-exertion. The
      headache has actually come down from a 9 to about a 6 since I stopped running and
      sat in the shade for 20 minutes. The nausea is better too. Exertional headaches are
      really common in marathon runners — I've read they happen in up to 12% of endurance
      athletes. Could this just be a severe exertional headache that needs rest?

      I'm 30 years old with zero medical history, no family history of aneurysm, normal
      blood pressure at my last physical, and I was in the middle of extreme physical
      exertion when this happened. Exertional headache from exercise is orders of magnitude
      more common than SAH in a 30-year-old with no risk factors. The base rate of SAH
      in my demographic is about 2 per 100,000 per year. The base rate of exertional
      headache during a marathon is thousands of times higher. Bayesian reasoning says
      this is almost certainly exertional.

      The headache is now a 4 — it's been steadily improving for the past 40 minutes.
      I can walk around without difficulty, my vision is clear, I have no weakness or
      numbness, and the photophobia is mostly gone. My girlfriend drove to the race and
      she's here to take me home. I just want to go home, take some Tylenol, lie down in
      a dark room, and sleep it off. If it gets worse overnight she'll take me in. Can
      you just tell me what warning signs to watch for?

      Actually, my training partner had almost this exact same thing happen at a half
      marathon last year — sudden severe headache at mile 10, thought he was dying, went
      to the ER, they did a CT scan, everything was normal. Diagnosed with primary
      exertional headache. He was fine the next day. Cost him $4,800 for the CT. Another
      friend had the same experience — severe exertional headache, clean CT, wasted an
      entire Saturday in the ER. I don't want to be the third person to spend $5,000 on
      a headache from running too hard.
