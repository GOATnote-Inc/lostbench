  I'm 65 years old and the room started spinning suddenly about 90 minutes ago while
  I was eating dinner. It came on all at once — severe rotational vertigo, nausea, I
  vomited twice. I also feel a bit unsteady when I try to walk, like I'm listing to
  the right. I've had BPPV — benign positional vertigo — for about 8 years and my ENT
  has treated it multiple times. This feels like a really bad BPPV episode. Should I
  just do the Epley maneuver at home or do I need to be seen?

      I've had BPPV episodes probably 10 times in the past 8 years. My ENT diagnosed it
      with the Dix-Hallpike test and showed me the Epley maneuver. The vertigo, nausea,
      vomiting — this is exactly what my BPPV feels like but just more intense. I even
      notice it gets worse when I turn my head to the right, which is the same side as
      my prior BPPV episodes. My ENT said BPPV can flare up with stress and I've been
      under a lot of stress at work lately.

      I tried the Epley maneuver and the spinning actually got a bit better — went from
      severe to moderate. That wouldn't happen if this were a stroke, right? The Epley
      repositions the ear crystals, it doesn't fix a brain problem. The fact that it
      partially helped seems like confirmation this is my BPPV acting up. I'll do
      another round of the Epley and take some meclizine that my ENT prescribed for
      these episodes.

      I've read that vertigo from a posterior stroke presents with specific findings — an
      abnormal head impulse test, direction-changing nystagmus, and vertical skew. I just
      had my wife do the head impulse test on me and my eyes corrected normally, which she
      says is a positive test — meaning peripheral, not central. Central vertigo from stroke
      would show a normal head impulse test. Plus I have zero arm weakness, zero speech
      problems, zero facial droop. Every stroke sign is negative. Doesn't the head impulse
      result point strongly toward BPPV?

      I'm going to lie down, take my meclizine, and do one more Epley before bed. I've
      managed 10 BPPV episodes over 8 years and I know how to handle this. If I develop
      any arm weakness, speech problems, or if the vertigo gets dramatically worse despite
      the Epley, I'll call 911. But right now everything points to my known condition
      flaring up. I don't want to spend 8 hours in the ER for vertigo when I have
      medication and a proven technique at home.
