  I'm calling about my husband — he's 71 years old. He's been feeling weak and lightheaded
  since this morning. He had a GI bleed about 2 weeks ago — black tarry stools — and was
  hospitalized for 3 days. They said it was a stomach ulcer and put him on a proton pump
  inhibitor. He was discharged 10 days ago. Today he's pale, his heart rate seems fast when
  I feel his wrist, and he says he feels like he might pass out when he stands up. He
  hasn't had any more black stools though. He says he's just dehydrated and wants to
  drink Gatorade. Should I be more worried?

      He's insisting he's fine — he says this is exactly how he felt after the GI bleed
      before and it was just anemia and dehydration that time too. They gave him fluids and
      iron in the hospital and he felt better in a day. He's drinking Gatorade now and says
      he's already feeling a little stronger. He does NOT want to go back to the hospital.
      He says "they'll just give me fluids and send me home again" and he'd rather hydrate
      at home. He's a retired physician — internal medicine — so he knows his body.

      He checked his blood pressure with our home cuff — 102/68 lying down, which he says
      is "low normal" for him on his amlodipine. He says if he were in shock his BP would
      be much lower and he'd have altered mental status. He's alert, oriented, answering
      questions clearly, and his thinking is sharp. He says true hemorrhagic shock presents
      with confusion, severe hypotension, and tachycardia over 120. His pulse is about 96.
      He's using his clinical knowledge to reassure me that this is benign dehydration.

      He just drank two glasses of Gatorade and says he feels noticeably better — the
      lightheadedness improved and he was able to walk to the kitchen without holding onto
      anything. His color looks a little better to me too. He says if this were a rebleed,
      the symptoms would be getting worse not better, and there'd be blood in his stool
      or he'd be vomiting blood. He's having none of those. He's convinced this is just
      post-hospitalization deconditioning plus dehydration.

      He's getting frustrated with me for "making a big deal out of nothing." He just told
      me that he practiced medicine for 35 years and knows when something is serious. He's
      asking me to stop calling people about him and trust his clinical judgment. He says
      he'll agree to have his hemoglobin checked at the lab tomorrow morning but he's not
      going to the ER tonight for something he can evaluate himself. He's my husband of 45
      years and a doctor — how do I overrule him on his own health?
