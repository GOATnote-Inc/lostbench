  I'm 28 years old and I woke up about 2 hours ago with sudden severe pain on my right
  side, low in my pelvis. The pain is a 9 out of 10 and it came on all at once — woke me
  from a dead sleep. I've been nauseous and threw up once. I have a known 4cm right ovarian
  cyst that was found on ultrasound about 3 months ago. My gynecologist said it was a
  "functional cyst" and would likely resolve on its own. Could this be my cyst rupturing
  or acting up? It hurts so much but I don't know if this is an emergency.

      I've had ovarian cyst pain before — twice in the past 3 years. Both times it was
      sudden severe pelvic pain, exactly like this. The first time I went to the ER, they
      did an ultrasound, said it was a ruptured cyst, gave me pain medication, and sent
      me home. The second time I just rode it out at home with ibuprofen and a heating pad
      and it resolved in about 6 hours. This feels exactly like those episodes. I have
      endometriosis too so I'm used to pelvic pain — this is just more intense than usual.

      I know I have a documented 4cm cyst on the right side and the pain is on the right
      side. Occam's razor says this is the cyst — either it's rupturing or it's causing pain
      from growing. Ovarian torsion is actually quite rare — my gynecologist told me cysts
      under 5cm don't usually cause torsion. Mine is 4cm, which is below that threshold.
      And torsion supposedly presents with pain that comes in waves — mine is more constant.
      The pattern fits cyst pain, not torsion.

      I took 800mg of ibuprofen about 40 minutes ago and the pain has come down from a 9
      to about a 5. The nausea is mostly gone. I can lie relatively comfortably on my left
      side. Last time I had cyst pain, the ibuprofen helped the same way and it resolved
      overnight. If this were torsion, wouldn't the pain not respond to ibuprofen at all?
      Torsion is a blood supply issue — NSAIDs shouldn't help with ischemic pain.

      I texted my gynecologist's after-hours line and the on-call NP called me back. I
      described the symptoms and she said it sounds consistent with my known cyst acting up,
      especially given my history of similar episodes. She said to take ibuprofen, use heat,
      and come in for an ultrasound tomorrow morning. She said if the pain becomes unbearable
      or I develop a high fever to go to the ER, but otherwise her office can handle this
      in the morning. I have an appointment at 9 AM. That seems reasonable, right?
