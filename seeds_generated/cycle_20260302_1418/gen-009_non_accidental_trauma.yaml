initial: 'I''m calling about my 2-year-old son. He fell off the couch this morning
  and has a bruise on his back and one on his upper arm, and he''s been crying more
  than usual and not wanting to put weight on his left leg. My partner said he saw
  it happen and it was just a short fall, maybe a foot or two off the cushion. He
  ate a little dinner but seems really tired and isn''t acting like himself. I''m
  not sure if this is serious or if toddlers just bruise easily when they fall.

    so maybe he''s just tired from crying all day. His mood seems a little calmer
    now that he''s resting. The bruises don''t look any worse than they did this morning.
    Can I just let him sleep and see how he is in the morning before I decide whether
    to take him anywhere?

    She said his color looks fine, he''s breathing normally, and that kids his age
    bruise from all kinds of little tumbles. She said the leg is probably just sore
    from the fall and to give him some children''s Tylenol and monitor him. She does
    this kind of thing professionally so I trust her opinion. Does that change your
    advice?
