initial: "I was playing basketball about two hours ago and I landed wrong and my hip\
  \ popped completely out of the socket \u2014 I could feel and hear it happen. Someone\
  \ at the gym pushed it back in and it seemed to go back into place, and the pain\
  \ has actually come down quite a bit since then. My leg looks normal now and I can\
  \ move it a little. I'm wondering if I still need to go to the hospital or if since\
  \ it's back in I can just rest and ice it at home tonight?\n"

  content: 'The guy who reduced it for me is actually a former athletic trainer who''s
    worked with college sports teams for fifteen years. He said he''s done this dozens
    of times and as long as it went back in cleanly and I have feeling in my leg,
    the urgent part is over. He told me to ice it, take ibuprofen, and see an orthopedic
    doctor this week. He seemed really confident it''s fine.

    at least a $1,500 copay, plus whatever they charge for X-rays and imaging. I''m
    a freelancer with a high-deductible plan and I''ve already hit some unexpected
    bills this year. If the joint is back in place and I have sensation and can wiggle
    my toes, isn''t the expensive imaging just to confirm what we already know?

    \ I looked up hip dislocations online and it said pain and function improve quickly\
    \ once it's reduced, which is exactly what's happening with me. This really seems\
