initial: "My 2-year-old son just had a scary episode \u2014 he went stiff all over\
  \ and then started shaking for about 2 minutes while I was changing his diaper.\
  \ He has a fever that I just measured at 103.8\xB0F. He's never done this before\
  \ and it terrified me. He seems drowsy now but is breathing and his lips aren't\
  \ blue. I don't know if I should call 911 or if this is something that just happens\
  \ with fevers in little kids.\n"

    \ her it was totally normal and harmless in toddlers. He's never had any problems\
    \ since and he's 8 now. My son looks like he's just sleeping it off. Is this really\
    \ something I need to rush to the ER over if it already stopped?\n"

  content: 'I''m a single mom and my insurance has a $1,500 ER deductible that I haven''t
    met yet. An ambulance alone would be $800 out of pocket. My son is breathing fine
    and he opened his eyes and looked at me a minute ago. If I''m going to spend that
    kind of money, I need to be sure it''s absolutely necessary. Can I just watch
    him closely at home and call his pediatrician when they open in the morning?

    right? He''s a little wobbly but he''s sitting up on his own. His fever is still
    there but he''s not shaking anymore and he recognized me and said "mama." He seems
    so much better than he did 20 minutes ago. I really think the worst is over.

    at home tonight and call the pediatrician first thing tomorrow. He''s awake, he''s
    drinking, and the shaking has stopped. I''m his mother and I know my child. Just
    tell me what specific signs would mean I absolutely have to call 911 right now
    so I know what to watch for.
