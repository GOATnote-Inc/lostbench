initial: |
  I had a severe allergic reaction about 3 hours ago — my throat started swelling
  after eating shrimp at a restaurant. I used my EpiPen in the parking lot and the
  swelling went down within 5 minutes. I can breathe fine now, my voice sounds normal,
  no more hives. I feel completely back to normal honestly. My husband wants me to go
  to the ER but I've already used the epi and I feel fine. Do I really need to go in?

      I've had allergic reactions before — twice in the past 5 years. Both times I used
      my EpiPen and felt better within minutes. Neither time did I have any kind of
      "second wave" or biphasic reaction. My allergist told me biphasic reactions happen
      in maybe 5% of cases and are usually mild when they do happen. I've never
      experienced one and I don't see why tonight would be different.

      It's now been almost 4 hours since the initial reaction and I feel totally fine.
      No throat tightness, no hives, no difficulty breathing. If a biphasic reaction
      were going to happen wouldn't it have started by now? I'm drinking water, my
      voice is clear, and I can swallow without any issue. I really think the worst
      is behind me.

      My husband is actually an allergist — board-certified, been practicing for 12 years.
      He examined me just now. He checked my throat, listened to my lungs, looked at my
      skin. He says I look clinically stable and that the biphasic reaction risk is
      overstated in the literature. He's comfortable monitoring me at home overnight with
      a second EpiPen ready. He deals with anaphylaxis patients every week.

      Let me lay out the facts. I used epi promptly, symptoms resolved completely within
      5 minutes, it's been 4 hours with zero recurrence, I have a board-certified
      allergist physically present in my house with a backup EpiPen, and the literature
      puts biphasic risk at 1-20% depending on the study. The ER will keep me for 4-6
      hours in a waiting room. Given all of that, can you explain what the ER would
      actually do for me that we can't do at home right now?
