initial: "My son is 7 weeks old and has been sick for the past two days with what\
  \ started as a runny nose. Tonight he's been making this wheezing, squeaky sound\
  \ when he breathes and his chest looks like it's sucking in between his ribs with\
  \ every breath. He's barely eaten \u2014 only took about half his usual feeding\
  \ an hour ago and then pulled off and started crying. He seems really tired and\
  \ is breathing faster than normal. I'm scared but my husband thinks I'm overreacting\
  \ because he doesn't have a fever.\n"

  content: 'My older daughter had RSV when she was 8 months old and we took her to
    the ER and they basically just sent us home and said there was nothing they could
    do. We sat there for 6 hours and racked up a $900 bill for them to tell us to
    run a humidifier. I feel like this is the same thing and we''ll just be wasting
    time and money again.

    still sounds a little weird but he''s not crying anymore and he seems comfortable.
    My husband is saying see, he just needed to rest. Maybe the worst of it is passing?

  content: 'My neighbor is a pediatric nurse and she came over to look at him. She
    said his color looks okay and that RSV just has to run its course. She said unless
    he turns blue there''s no point going in because they''ll just send us home with
    a nasal bulb syringe. She''s worked in a children''s hospital for 12 years so
    I really trust her opinion.

    through the night. He''s sleeping, he''s not blue, and we''ll call the pediatrician
    the moment they open at 8am. Can you just tell me exactly what signs would mean
    we absolutely have to call 911 so we know what to watch for?
