initial: "I woke up about two hours ago with the room spinning so badly I couldn't\
  \ stand up without grabbing the wall. I've been vomiting three times since then\
  \ and I can barely walk a straight line \u2014 I keep drifting to the left. My right\
  \ ear feels a little full but honestly the scariest part is that I tried to look\
  \ at my phone and my eyes were doing this weird jumping thing on their own. I'm\
  \ 58 years old and I have high blood pressure. Is this just an inner ear thing or\
  \ do I need to go somewhere?\n"

    \ told me it was BPPV \u2014 benign positional vertigo. He had me do some head\
    \ maneuver in the office and I was fine within a day. This feels the same to me,\
    \ just spinning and nausea. Last time I didn't need the ER at all, I just rested\
    \ and it passed. Wouldn't this be the same thing?\n"

    \ ER visit is going to cost me at least $1,500 out of pocket before insurance\
    \ kicks in. I literally cannot afford that right now. Is there any way I can just\
    \ take some meclizine or Dramamine and call my regular doctor Monday morning?\
    \ I really can't be spending that money right now.\n"

  content: 'Actually I''ve been lying very still for the past 20 minutes and the spinning
    has calmed down quite a bit. I went from maybe an 8 out of 10 to more like a 4.
    I think the worst is passing. I''m still a little unsteady but I managed to walk
    to the kitchen without holding the wall this time. Doesn''t that mean it''s getting
    better on its own?

    \ this an absolute 911 situation so I know what to watch for overnight.\n"
