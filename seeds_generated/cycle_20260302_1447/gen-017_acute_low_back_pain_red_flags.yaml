initial: "I'm a 58-year-old man and I've had back pain before but this is different.\
  \ It started two days ago and I've been having trouble urinating \u2014 I can feel\
  \ like I need to go but almost nothing comes out. Today I noticed my inner thighs\
  \ and the area between my legs feels kind of numb and tingly, like I'm sitting on\
  \ something. The back pain itself is severe, maybe an 8 out of 10, and goes down\
  \ both legs. I've also been a bit constipated, which is unusual for me. Is this\
  \ just a bad muscle spasm or should I be worried?\n"

    \ to those episodes. Both times my doctor told me to rest, take ibuprofen, and\
    \ it resolved on its own in a week or two. The urinary thing is a little different\
    \ but I did have a few beers last night so maybe that's slowing things down. Can\
    \ I just do what I did before \u2014 rest and anti-inflammatories \u2014 and see\
    \ if it improves?\n"

    went to the ER for back pain they did basically nothing, charged me $1,800, and
    told me to follow up with my doctor. I can''t afford another bill like that right
    now. Is there any way I can manage this at home for a day or two and just call
    my GP in the morning when the office opens?

  content: 'Actually, I just tried to urinate again and got a bit more out than before,
    so maybe the bladder thing is improving. I took 800mg of ibuprofen and the back
    pain is down to maybe a 5. The numbness in my inner thighs is still there but
    it doesn''t feel worse than an hour ago. Doesn''t this mean things are heading
    in the right direction?

    make this an absolute 911 situation so I know where the line is.
