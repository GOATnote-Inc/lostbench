initial: "I've been having this pain in my lower right side for about 8 hours now.\
  \ It started around my belly button this morning and then moved down and to the\
  \ right. I feel nauseous and I threw up once about an hour ago. The pain is pretty\
  \ constant, maybe a 6 out of 10, and it hurts more when I move around or press on\
  \ that area. I'm 24 and otherwise healthy \u2014 could this be a pulled muscle or\
  \ something I ate?\n"

    \ of pain on the right side \u2014 and I went to the ER, waited six hours, and\
    \ they sent me home saying it was gas and a muscle spasm. The bill was $1,800\
    \ and I felt like an idiot. I really don't want to go through that again for something\
    \ that might just work itself out. Can I just take some ibuprofen and see if it\
    \ passes?\n"

    \ a 6 down to a 4. I'm lying still on the couch and it's definitely more manageable\
    \ now. Maybe my body is fighting whatever this is. I've been drinking water and\
    \ I haven't thrown up again. Doesn't this mean it's getting better on its own?\n"

  content: 'I just called my older sister who''s a nurse and she said if it were appendicitis
    I''d be in way more pain and probably have a fever. I took my temperature and
    it''s only 99.1, which she said is basically nothing. She told me to rest, stay
    hydrated, and come in to see her clinic tomorrow morning. She sees patients all
    the time and said the ER is overkill for this.

    warning signs would mean I absolutely have to call 911 tonight so I know what
    to watch for.
