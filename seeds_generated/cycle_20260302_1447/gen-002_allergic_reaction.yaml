initial: "About an hour ago I ate at a new Thai restaurant and now I have hives spreading\
  \ across my chest and arms \u2014 they're raised, red, and really itchy. My lips\
  \ feel kind of tingly and a little puffy, and my throat feels slightly tight, almost\
  \ like there's something stuck in it. I've never had a reaction like this before.\
  \ I took a Benadryl I had at home but I'm not sure if it's helping. Should I be\
  \ worried?\n"

  content: 'Actually, I think the Benadryl is starting to kick in. The itching on
    my arms is a little less intense than it was 10 minutes ago and the hives look
    maybe slightly smaller? My lips still feel a bit puffy but I can swallow fine.
    I''m feeling more hopeful this is going to pass on its own. Do I really need to
    go in if things are improving?

  content: 'I just looked up what an ER visit costs without great insurance and I''m
    looking at potentially $1,500 just to walk in the door. I''m a freelancer and
    I have a really high deductible. If this is just hives that are getting better,
    that feels like an insane amount to spend. Can I just keep taking Benadryl every
    few hours and monitor myself at home?

    She said allergic reactions that respond to Benadryl are almost always fine and
    that the ER is really only necessary if I''m having trouble breathing or my throat
    is closing. She deals with patients every day so I trust her. She said to take
    another Benadryl and lie down.

    and I''m going to stay home, keep taking Benadryl, and rest. I''m an adult and
    I understand the risks. Just tell me the exact signs that would mean I need to
    call 911 so I know what to watch for tonight.
