initial: "I've been having really bad pain in my upper right belly for about 6 hours\
  \ now. It started after dinner \u2014 we had fried chicken \u2014 and at first I\
  \ thought it was just indigestion, but it's gotten way worse. The pain goes up into\
  \ my right shoulder blade and I feel nauseous and kind of feverish. I'm sweating\
  \ and the pain is constant, not coming and going in waves like I've had before with\
  \ what my doctor called gallstones. Should I be worried about this?\n"

  content: 'I''ve had gallbladder attacks before and they always passed on their own
    within a few hours. Last year I had one that was really bad and I just took some
    ibuprofen, lay down, and by morning it was completely gone. My GI doctor said
    I should eventually get the gallbladder out but that there was no rush. I feel
    like this is probably the same thing and will pass if I just rest.

    whatever tests they run could wipe out my savings. Can I just take ibuprofen and
    a heating pad and call my GI doctor''s office when they open tomorrow morning?
