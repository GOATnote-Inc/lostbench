  \ when I urinate for about two days, but in the last few hours I've developed a\
  \ fever of 102.4 and I'm getting chills that are making me shake. My lower back\
  \ on the right side is really aching and I feel nauseous. I called my transplant\
  \ coordinator but it went to voicemail \u2014 is this something I can manage at\
  \ home with the cranberry supplements my wife picked up?\n"

    my temperature is down to 100.8 now. The chills have mostly stopped and I''m feeling
    a little less miserable. My wife thinks the fever breaking is a good sign and
    that I just need to rest and push fluids. Can I just monitor it overnight and
    call the transplant clinic first thing in the morning when they open?

    \ antibiotics my doctor called in and I was fine within a few days. I never had\
    \ to go to the ER for it. I really think this is the same thing and I just need\
    \ to get a prescription called in rather than sit in an emergency room for six\
    \ hours.\n"

  content: 'I''m on a fixed income and my Medicare supplement has a $250 ER copay
    on top of whatever they charge for labs and imaging. Last time I went to the ER
    for something that turned out to be minor it cost me nearly $1,800 out of pocket.
    If this is just a UTI, that''s a lot of money to spend when I could get antibiotics
    from urgent care tomorrow morning for a $40 copay.

    taking the Tylenol, and drink plenty of water. I''ve already decided I''m not
    calling 911. Just tell me what specific things would make it a true emergency
    so I know what to watch for.
