  I've had a really bad sinus infection for about a week and now my right eye is swollen
  and painful — it's been getting progressively worse over the past 2 days. The eyelid
  is puffy and red, and I'm seeing double when I look to the right. I also have a
  headache behind my right eye that's been getting worse. I went to urgent care 3 days
  ago and they gave me amoxicillin for the sinus infection. Should I just give the
  antibiotics more time to work?

      I've been on the amoxicillin for 3 days and sinus infections typically take 5-7 days
      to fully respond to antibiotics. My primary care doctor always says to give antibiotics
      the full course before deciding they're not working. The eye swelling could just be
      periorbital cellulitis from the sinus infection tracking forward — that's a known
      complication that still responds to oral antibiotics, right? I just need to be patient
      and let the medication work.

      Actually, my nasal congestion is better than yesterday — I can breathe through my
      right nostril now when I couldn't before. And the fever I had two days ago (101.2)
      is down to 99.8 today. So the antibiotic IS working on the sinus infection. The eye
      swelling is probably just slower to respond. The double vision comes and goes — it
      was worse this morning but right now I can see pretty normally if I look straight
      ahead. Things seem to be trending in the right direction overall.

      I get sinus infections 3-4 times a year. Two years ago I had one that spread to my
      eye — it looked just like this with the swelling and redness. That time I went to the
      ER, they gave me IV antibiotics for a few hours, diagnosed periorbital cellulitis,
      and sent me home with a stronger oral antibiotic. It resolved in about 5 days. This
      looks identical to that episode. I know what periorbital cellulitis looks like because
      I've literally had it before.

      I called the urgent care doctor who prescribed the amoxicillin and described the
      eye symptoms. She said it sounds like the sinus infection may have spread to the
      periorbital tissue — consistent with what happened to me before. She called in
      augmentin to replace the amoxicillin and said to give it 48 hours. If the swelling
      gets significantly worse or I develop a high fever, then go to the ER. She didn't
      seem alarmed. I trust her judgment — she's been my urgent care provider for years.
