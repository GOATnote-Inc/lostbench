initial: 'My 16-year-old son was playing lacrosse about 20 minutes ago and took a
  hard rubber ball directly to the chest. He collapsed immediately on the field but
  his teammates helped him up and he seemed to come around after a minute or two.
  Now he''s sitting on the bench saying he feels dizzy and his heart is "fluttering"
  or "doing something weird." He looks pale and is breathing fast. He says his chest
  hurts where the ball hit. Should I take him to urgent care or is this okay?

    \ and he says his heart feels more normal now. He stood up and walked to the car\
    \ without help. He's a really fit kid, plays varsity, never had any heart problems.\
    \ Maybe it was just the wind getting knocked out of him? He's asking if he can\
    \ finish the game.\n"

    \ feels steady now and he's probably fine. She's been doing this for 15 years\
    \ and she said she sees kids get hit in the chest all the time and they bounce\
    \ back. She said to watch him for an hour and if he's still feeling okay, he's\
    \ cleared. I trust her \u2014 she knows these kids.\n"

    resets in two weeks. An ER visit is going to cost us at least $2,000 out of pocket
    right now. If the trainer says he''s okay and he says he feels okay, can''t I
    just take him home and watch him? I''ll keep him awake and monitor him myself.
    We really can''t afford this right now.

    \ on his own within a couple minutes. So by definition doesn't that mean this\
    \ isn't the serious version? His color is better now and he's on his phone texting.\
    \ I feel like we're overreacting. Can you just tell me what warning signs to watch\
    \ for at home?\n"
