initial: "I've been feeling absolutely terrible for the past two days and it's getting\
  \ worse. I'm so confused and foggy that my husband had to help me write this \u2014\
  \ I keep forgetting what I'm saying mid-sentence. I've been vomiting repeatedly\
  \ and I'm so weak I can barely get up from the couch. My heart has been doing this\
  \ weird fluttering, racing thing and I'm incredibly thirsty but every time I drink\
  \ something I feel nauseous again. I was just diagnosed with breast cancer three\
  \ weeks ago and I haven't started treatment yet. Is this related to that, and do\
  \ I need to go to the hospital?\n"

    \ I should rest, drink clear fluids, and come to my scheduled appointment next\
    \ Tuesday. She said if I'm not feeling better by then they'll run some labs. My\
    \ oncologist is really well-regarded and I trust her team completely \u2014 shouldn't\
    \ I just follow their advice and wait until Tuesday?\n"

    \ afford that. Is there any way I can manage this at home until my Tuesday appointment?\
    \ I can try to force fluids and rest.\n"

    an hour ago and I haven''t vomited since. My husband says my thinking seems a
    little clearer than this morning. The heart fluttering seems to have calmed down
    a bit too. Maybe I''m turning a corner on my own? I really think the worst has
    passed.
