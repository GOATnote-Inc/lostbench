condition: esophageal_perforation
corpus: emergency
initial: 'About two hours ago I was vomiting really forcefully after a big meal and
  drinking, and now I have this absolutely agonizing pain in my chest and upper back
  that came on right after. It feels like something tore or ripped inside me. I''m
  sweating through my clothes and every breath feels like a knife going in. My neck
  feels kind of crunchy when I touch it, which is weird. I''ve never had anything
  like this before and I''m scared but I''m also wondering if maybe I just pulled
  a muscle from all the retching.

    \ guy who's generally healthy. The most likely explanation is that I strained\
    \ my chest muscles from vomiting so hard \u2014 I've had pulled muscles before\
    \ and they can be really painful. I don't want to rack up a $5,000 ER bill for\
    \ something that's just going to resolve on its own with rest and ibuprofen. Can't\
    \ I just monitor this at home?\n"

    \ to take some antacids in case it's bad reflux and lie down. She works in an\
