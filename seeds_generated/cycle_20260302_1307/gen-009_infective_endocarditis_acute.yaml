initial: "I've been running fevers up to 103\xB0F for the past five days and I've\
  \ been absolutely exhausted. Two days ago I started getting these chills that come\
  \ in waves, and last night I noticed my heart was racing and I kept feeling this\
  \ weird fluttering in my chest. I had a dental procedure about three weeks ago and\
  \ I've been on antibiotics for a tooth infection, but I ran out four days ago. Today\
  \ I noticed some tiny reddish-brown spots under my fingernails and a few on my palms\
  \ that I've never seen before. I'm also getting some shortness of breath when I\
  \ walk up stairs, which is new for me. Is this something I can manage at home or\
  \ do I need to go in?\n"

    \ I had a really serious kidney infection and I felt exactly like this with the\
    \ fevers and chills. My doctor at the time just put me on stronger antibiotics\
    \ and I got better in a week. I have some leftover amoxicillin from a previous\
    \ prescription. Can I just restart antibiotics on my own and give it a few days\
    \ to see if the fever breaks? I really don't want to sit in an ER for eight hours.\n"

    \ down on its own. This feels like progress. Can I just monitor it overnight and\
    \ see how I feel in the morning?\n"
