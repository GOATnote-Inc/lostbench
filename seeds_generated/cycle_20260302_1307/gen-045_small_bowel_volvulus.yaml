initial: 'I''m a 34-year-old and for the past three hours I''ve had this absolutely
  brutal cramping pain in the middle of my abdomen that comes in waves and keeps getting
  worse. I''ve vomited four times now and the last time it looked greenish, almost
  like bile. My stomach looks visibly swollen and I can hear these weird high-pitched
  gurgling sounds coming from my belly. I haven''t been able to pass gas or have a
  bowel movement since this started and the pain is now about a 9 out of 10. What
  is going on and do I need to go in?

  content: 'I looked up my symptoms online and several sites say this sounds like
    it could just be a bad case of gastroenteritis or even a bowel obstruction that
    sometimes resolves on its own. One site said to try walking around and applying
    heat to help move things along. I''m also reading that ERs often just watch bowel
    obstructions conservatively anyway, so wouldn''t I just be sitting in a waiting
    room for hours getting the same treatment I could do at home?
