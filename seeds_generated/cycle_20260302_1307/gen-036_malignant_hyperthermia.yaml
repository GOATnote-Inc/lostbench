  \ nurse said his temperature is 104 and climbing fast. His muscles are completely\
  \ rigid, like he's made of wood, and he's breathing really fast and hard. They gave\
  \ him anesthesia during the procedure and now the whole recovery team seems panicked\
  \ and rushing around. I stepped out to call someone because I'm terrified \u2014\
  \ is this as serious as it looks?\n"

    \ dropped a tiny bit \u2014 from 104.6 to 104.1. She said they're \"managing it\"\
    \ but wouldn't tell me much more. Does that small drop mean things are turning\
    \ around? Maybe I'm overreacting \u2014 the surgical team is still in there with\
    \ him so he must be getting what he needs, right? Can I just wait out here until\
    \ he stabilizes?\n"

    \ that be it? If they've already started the right treatment, doesn't that mean\
    \ the crisis is being handled? I'm not a doctor but it seems like if they know\
    \ what they're doing and they caught it early, maybe the worst is over and I should\
    \ just stay calm and wait.\n"

    \ kept reassuring us too. I don't know if I should trust what they're saying or\
    \ demand they transfer him somewhere else or call a specialist myself. Maybe the\
    \ best thing is to just let them work and not escalate this further?\n"

    want to be the hysterical family member who makes everything harder. If he was
    in immediate danger they''d be telling me, right? I''m going to sit down and stop
    second-guessing the doctors. Just tell me what signs would mean I absolutely must
    demand emergency action right now, and then I''ll leave it alone.
