initial: 'My husband collapsed in the kitchen about an hour ago and stopped breathing.
  I did CPR and the paramedics came and got his heart going again after about 8 minutes.
  They brought him to the ER and they stabilized him, but he''s home now because he
  said he felt okay and just wanted to leave. He''s conscious and talking but he seems
  confused about what day it is and keeps saying his chest feels heavy. His skin looks
  kind of grayish and he''s shivering even though the house is warm. Should I be worried
  or is this normal after something like that?

    is a little better than it was when we first got home. He recognized our dog and
    laughed at something on TV, so his confusion seems to be clearing up too. He''s
    resting on the couch and his color looks a tiny bit better. Maybe his body just
    needs time to recover from the shock of everything?

    our deductible resets in January which is two weeks away. Another hospitalization
    right now would wipe us out financially. He has a follow-up scheduled with his
    cardiologist for next week. Is there any way we can manage this at home and just
    monitor him closely until that appointment?
