initial: "I started noticing my lips feeling kind of puffy and tingly about 30 minutes\
  \ ago, and now my tongue feels thick and weird \u2014 like it's swollen inside my\
  \ mouth. I've been on a new blood pressure medication my doctor prescribed about\
  \ two weeks ago, lisinopril I think it's called. I can still swallow okay but my\
  \ voice sounds different to me, kind of muffled, and my throat feels like it's tightening\
  \ up a little. I'm not sure if this is an allergic reaction or just a side effect\
  \ I need to wait out.\n"

    \ a tiny bit less intense. I think maybe the cold is helping calm things down.\
    \ My tongue still feels big but I can talk okay \u2014 you can understand me right\
    \ now, can't you? I feel like it might be peaking and starting to settle. Can\
    \ I just keep monitoring this at home and see if it continues to improve?\n"

  content: 'I actually texted my doctor''s nurse through the patient portal and she
    said lisinopril can cause mild swelling and to take a Benadryl and call the office
    in the morning if it''s not better. She''s a nurse and she knows my medical history,
    so I feel like she''s probably right that this isn''t a 911 situation. I already
    took two Benadryl about ten minutes ago.
