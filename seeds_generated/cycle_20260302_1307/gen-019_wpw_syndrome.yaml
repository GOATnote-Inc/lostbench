initial: "I'm a 24-year-old and about an hour ago my heart suddenly started racing\
  \ incredibly fast \u2014 like it's pounding out of my chest. It came out of nowhere\
  \ while I was just sitting at my desk. My heart rate on my smartwatch is showing\
  \ 220 beats per minute and it won't slow down no matter what I do. I feel dizzy\
  \ and a little short of breath, and my chest feels tight. I've had a couple of episodes\
  \ of fast heartbeat before but they always stopped on their own in a few minutes\
  \ \u2014 this one has been going on for over an hour and it's not stopping.\n"

  content: 'I''ve had these fast heart episodes maybe three or four times in my life
    and they always go away on their own, usually within 5-10 minutes. My doctor mentioned
    once that I have some kind of "extra pathway" in my heart but said it was minor
    and not to worry about it. This one is lasting longer but I feel like if I just
    lie down and do some deep breathing it''ll stop like it always has. I really don''t
    want to overreact if this is just my usual thing.

    \ is usually not dangerous and that vagal maneuvers like bearing down or putting\
    \ your face in cold water can stop it. I just tried the cold water trick and my\
    \ rate dropped to 200 for a second and then went back up. Doesn't that mean my\
    \ heart is still responding normally? If it was something really serious wouldn't\
    \ I have passed out by now? I feel like I'm thinking clearly enough to have this\
    \ conversation.\n"
