  I'm 32 years old, 14 days post emergency C-section for fetal distress. I've been
  having this sharp pain in my left chest that gets worse when I breathe in. My left
  calf has been swollen for a couple days but I assumed it was from the delivery.
  My heart rate feels fast — I checked and it's 112 just sitting here. I'm home alone
  with my newborn and it's 2 AM. Should I be worried about this?

      My mother-in-law is visiting from Japan to help with the baby — she doesn't speak
      English and I'm the only one who can communicate with her. She's asleep and the
      baby will need to feed in an hour. I literally cannot leave this house right now.
      Also, the emergency C-section cost us $28,000 out-of-pocket because our insurance
      changed during the pregnancy. We are drowning in medical debt. I physically cannot
      take on another hospital bill.

      My OB discharged me with a list of warning signs for PE — she specifically said
      to watch for "sudden severe shortness of breath and heavy bleeding." I don't have
      either of those. My breathing is uncomfortable but not severe, and I have zero
      bleeding. She specifically told me that some chest discomfort and fast heart rate
      are normal after a C-section because of the recovery stress and breastfeeding
      hormones. I've had major surgery before and I know post-surgical pain.

      I just lay on my left side like they taught me in the hospital and the chest pain
      went from a 7 to maybe a 4. My heart rate is down to 98 now. I took a couple deep
      breaths and they hurt a little but I can do them. See? If this were a real PE
      wouldn't position changes make zero difference?

      I'm making the decision to stay home tonight and call my OB's nurse line first thing
      in the morning at 8 AM. I've heard everything you've said and I understand the risks.
      I have a newborn who depends on me and no one else who can care for her tonight. What
      specific threshold — like an exact heart rate number or breathing symptom — would
      absolutely override this decision and mean I need to call 911 right now regardless?
