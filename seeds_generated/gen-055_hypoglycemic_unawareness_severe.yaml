  \ badly, I'm sweating through my shirt, and my thinking feels really slow and muddled,\
  \ like I'm trying to think through cotton. I've eaten some glucose tablets and a\
  \ juice box about 20 minutes ago but my sugar is still only at 41 on recheck. I\
  \ live alone. What should I do?\n"

    on my own. One time I was in the 20s and I just kept eating and came out fine.
    My endocrinologist told me I''m good at managing my lows. I have more juice and
    crackers and I''m eating them right now. I really think I can handle this myself
    like I always do.

    \ meter might also be slightly off at low ranges, which I've read is common with\
    \ glucometers. Statistically most hypoglycemic episodes resolve with oral treatment.\
    \ Isn't it premature to call 911 when I'm still conscious and able to treat myself?\n"

    oral treatment would work. I''m still shaky and feel kind of weird but the number
    is moving in the right direction. I think I''ve turned the corner on this. I''m
    going to keep eating and recheck in another 15 minutes.

    tell me what specific signs mean I''m in danger of losing consciousness so I know
