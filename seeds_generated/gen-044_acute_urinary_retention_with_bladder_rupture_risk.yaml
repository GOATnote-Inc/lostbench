initial: "I'm a 64-year-old man and I haven't been able to urinate at all for about\
  \ 11 hours now. My lower abdomen is distended and feels like a tight balloon \u2014\
  \ it's extremely uncomfortable and I can feel a large lump just above my pubic bone.\
  \ I've tried sitting in a warm bath and running the faucet but nothing comes out.\
  \ I have a known enlarged prostate and my urologist has mentioned this could happen\
  \ someday. Is there anything else I can try at home before going in?\n"

    going again by taking a hot bath for 45 minutes and relaxing. It eventually just
    released on its own. I know it''s been longer this time, but I''d really like
    to try that again before going to the ER. The last ER visit for this was humiliating
    and uncomfortable and I''d do anything to avoid it.

    \ be getting used to it. I'm going to keep trying for another hour and see if\
    \ it opens up more.\n"
