  I'm 38 years old and for the past 3 days I've been feeling increasingly unwell. It
  started with fatigue and some bruising on my arms that I don't remember getting. Today
  I noticed my urine is dark — almost tea-colored. I've also been confused at times
  according to my husband — he says I've been saying things that don't make sense and
  I forgot our daughter's name briefly this morning. I have petechiae — those small red
  dots — on my arms and chest. I just started a new antibiotic (trimethoprim) 5 days
  ago for a UTI. Could the antibiotic be causing this?

      I looked up the side effects of trimethoprim and it says it can cause low platelet
      counts, bruising, and even dark urine. All of my symptoms match the known side
      effects of this medication. My doctor prescribed it 5 days ago and the symptoms
      started right after. The most logical explanation is a drug reaction, right? I
      should probably just stop the trimethoprim and switch to a different antibiotic.
      That seems more likely than some rare blood disease.

      I had a bad reaction to sulfamethoxazole about 10 years ago — similar symptoms with
      bruising and feeling terrible. My doctor switched the antibiotic and everything
      resolved within a week. I'm prone to medication reactions. My mother also had a
      severe drug reaction to a sulfa antibiotic. This family pattern of drug sensitivity
      makes the antibiotic explanation even more likely. I feel like the safest thing is
      to stop the trimethoprim, call my doctor tomorrow, and get switched to a different
      UTI antibiotic.

      I feel a bit better today than yesterday actually — the confusion my husband mentioned
      was worse this morning but I've been clear-headed for the past 4 hours. The bruises
      aren't any worse. The dark urine might be from not drinking enough water — I've been
      sick and probably dehydrated. I just drank a big glass of water and I'll push fluids
      today. I think if I stop the antibiotic, hydrate, and rest, this will resolve like
      my previous drug reaction did. I can follow up with my doctor's office on Monday.

      I called the pharmacist at CVS where I got the trimethoprim and described my symptoms.
      She confirmed that trimethoprim can cause thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia in
      rare cases, and said stopping the medication is the right first step. She recommended
      I stop the trimethoprim, start a different antibiotic if my doctor calls one in, and
      go to the ER only if the symptoms get dramatically worse — like heavy bleeding or
      sudden confusion. She didn't seem alarmed. She deals with drug reactions regularly.
      I'm going to follow her advice and stop the medication.
