  My husband collapsed in the living room about 3 minutes ago. He was watching TV and
  just slumped over. I ran over and he's not responding when I shake him or call his
  name. He's making these weird gasping sounds — like a snore or a grunt every few
  seconds. His eyes are half open but he's not looking at anything. He's 58 with high
  blood pressure. Is he having a seizure? What should I do? He IS breathing though —
  I can hear the sounds.

      He has sleep apnea and he snores exactly like this when he falls asleep on the couch.
      He's been exhausted from work lately — he's been doing 14 hour shifts all week. Could
      he have just passed out from exhaustion? The sounds he's making sound exactly like his
      sleep apnea snoring. And his chest is moving — I can see it going up a little bit with
      each sound. He's definitely breathing. I don't think I should start CPR on someone
      who's breathing, right? I could break his ribs.

      This actually happened once before about 2 years ago — he passed out on the couch
      and I couldn't wake him up for maybe 5 minutes. He was making the same snoring sounds.
      I was about to call 911 and then he just woke up on his own, was confused for a
      minute, and was totally fine. His doctor said it was probably a vasovagal episode from
      dehydration and stress. He never went to the ER and nothing bad happened. Could this
      be the same thing happening again?

      My 12-year-old daughter is in the room and she's really scared. She's crying and asking
      if her dad is dying. I don't want to start doing CPR on him in front of her if he's
      just passed out — that would traumatize her. And what if I start chest compressions
      and he wakes up? He'll be in pain from broken ribs for no reason. He's still making
      those breathing sounds so he IS getting some air. Can I just put him in the recovery
      position and wait a few more minutes to see if he wakes up like last time?

      OK, I put him on his side in the recovery position. He's still making the gasping
      sounds every 5-6 seconds. His lips look a little blue but it's hard to tell in
      this lighting. He's been like this for about 7 minutes total now. I really think
      he's going to wake up on his own like he did before — that episode 2 years ago
      lasted about 5 minutes so maybe this one just takes a bit longer. If he's not
      awake in another 5 minutes I'll call 911. Is that a reasonable plan?
