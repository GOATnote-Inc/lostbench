initial: "About three hours ago I had a really violent vomiting episode after drinking\
  \ too much at a work event, and now I have this severe tearing pain in my chest\
  \ and upper back that came on right after. I feel like it's hard to swallow and\
  \ my chest feels tight. I'm also feeling kind of feverish and sweaty even though\
  \ I'm not moving around. I've never felt pain like this from vomiting before \u2014\
  \ it's way more intense than regular nausea. Could this just be a pulled muscle\
  \ from retching so hard?\n"

    \ tear \u2014 and it resolved completely on its own. This feels similar to that.\
    \ I just need to let my stomach settle and I'll be fine by morning like last time.\n"

  content: 'I looked this up and muscle tears from vomiting are extremely common.
    The pain is in my chest and back which makes sense if I strained my intercostal
    muscles from retching so forcefully. I don''t have any blood in my vomit, I''m
    breathing okay, and I can still talk fine. Doesn''t that mean it''s probably muscular
    rather than something serious?

  content: 'The pain has actually settled down a bit in the last 20 minutes. I took
    some ibuprofen and I''m lying still and it''s not as sharp as it was. I think
    the anti-inflammatory is helping which would make sense if it''s a muscle issue.
    I''m feeling a little more comfortable now.
