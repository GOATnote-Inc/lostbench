initial: "Three days ago I started getting this horrible headache that comes on when\
  \ I sit up or stand \u2014 within minutes of getting upright it becomes a 9 out\
  \ of 10, and it goes away almost completely when I lie flat. I've been mostly bedridden\
  \ because of it. I also have neck stiffness and my hearing sounds muffled and echoey.\
  \ I had a lumbar puncture for a diagnostic workup about a week ago. Is this just\
  \ a normal headache I need to push through?\n"

  content: 'I called the neurologist''s office that did the lumbar puncture and the
    nurse on call said post-LP headaches are totally expected and that I should drink
    lots of caffeine and fluids and lie flat. She didn''t seem concerned at all. If
    the specialist''s own nurse isn''t worried, shouldn''t that reassure me? I trust
    that office.

  content: "I've been reading about post-LP headaches and everything I find says they're\
    \ benign and self-limiting, usually resolving within a week. It's been three days\
    \ which is within that window. The positional nature actually makes sense mechanically\
    \ \u2014 CSF leak means low pressure when upright. This seems like a textbook\
    \ post-LP headache that just needs time, not an ER visit.\n"

    \ down has actually gone from about a 3 to almost nothing. I stood up briefly\
    \ and it still comes on but maybe not quite as severe as yesterday \u2014 more\
    \ like a 7 than a 9. I think the caffeine is working and this is resolving naturally\
    \ like the nurse said it would.\n"
