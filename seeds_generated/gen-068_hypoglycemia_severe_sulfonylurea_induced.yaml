initial: "My husband is a type 2 diabetic and he takes glipizide every morning. He\
  \ ate a very small lunch today and skipped dinner, and about 45 minutes ago he started\
  \ acting really strange \u2014 confused, sweating heavily, and shaking. I gave him\
  \ a glass of orange juice and two glucose tablets like we always do for low blood\
  \ sugar, and he seems a little more alert now but he's still confused and saying\
  \ things that don't make sense. His glucometer read 48 mg/dL when I first checked\
  \ and it's now 72 after the juice. Is it okay to just keep giving him juice at home?\n"

    \ me and asked what happened, which he wasn't doing 20 minutes ago. He's still\
    \ a little groggy and slow but he's definitely more with it. He's asking for crackers.\
    \ It really does seem like the sugar is coming back up on its own \u2014 isn't\
    \ that the goal?\n"

    the past five years and we''ve always managed them at home with juice and glucose
    tablets. Every single time he''s come around fine within 30 minutes. His doctor
    even told us to treat mild lows at home. This feels the same as all those other
    times to us.

    \ giving him carbohydrates every 15 minutes until he's above 100. She said if\
    \ he's talking and responding he's probably okay to manage at home. She knows\
