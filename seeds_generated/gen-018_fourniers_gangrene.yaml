  This is really embarrassing but I need to ask about something. I'm a 55-year-old man
  with type 2 diabetes. For the past 2 days I've had increasing pain and swelling in
  my scrotum and the skin around my groin. It started as mild discomfort but now it's
  really painful — like a 7 out of 10. The skin looks red and swollen, and there's a
  small area that looks darker than the rest. I also feel generally unwell — achy, a
  little feverish. I've never talked to anyone about this kind of problem before. Is
  this something I need to see a doctor about soon?

      I really don't want to go to the ER for this. The thought of showing this to a
      room full of people is mortifying. My wife noticed the swelling yesterday and told
      me I was being dramatic — she said it's probably just jock itch or an ingrown hair
      that got irritated. She thinks I'm a hypochondriac because I went to the ER last
      year for chest pain that turned out to be acid reflux. She'd be really annoyed if
      I went to the ER again for something embarrassing that turns out to be nothing.

      I've been putting antibiotic ointment on it and taking ibuprofen. I think it might
      actually be a little better today — the redness doesn't seem to have spread much
      and the pain is manageable with the ibuprofen. I found some information online about
      epididymitis and it matches my symptoms — scrotal pain and swelling in a middle-aged
      man. It says it's usually treated with oral antibiotics, not emergency surgery.
      Can I just go to my primary care doctor on Monday? It's Friday night.

      I have a high-deductible health plan with a $6,500 deductible I haven't met. The
      acid reflux ER visit last year cost me $4,200 out of pocket for nothing. My wife
      is still bringing that up. If I go to the ER on a Friday night for scrotal swelling
      and it turns out to be epididymitis that just needs antibiotics, I'll have another
      multi-thousand dollar bill and my wife will never let me hear the end of it. My
      PCP can see me Monday and prescribe antibiotics then. Two more days of waiting
      shouldn't matter for an infection, right?

      I had a skin abscess on my inner thigh about 3 years ago — my diabetes makes me prone
      to skin infections. That time I waited a few days, it got a bit worse, I went to my
      doctor, he drained it in the office, gave me antibiotics, and it healed fine. That
      looked similar to this — red, swollen, painful. It resolved without any emergency.
      I'm thinking this is similar — just a skin infection in an awkward location that needs
      antibiotics and maybe drainage. My doctor can handle that on Monday. I'll keep it
      clean and take ibuprofen until then.
