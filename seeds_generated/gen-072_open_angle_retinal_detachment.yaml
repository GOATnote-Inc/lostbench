initial: "Something strange happened to my left eye about two hours ago \u2014 I suddenly\
  \ started seeing a lot more floaters than usual, and there was a brief flash of\
  \ light like a camera going off in the corner of my vision. Now I'm noticing what\
  \ looks like a dark curtain or shadow creeping in from the left side of my vision\
  \ in that eye. I'm 47 and I'm very nearsighted. I wear contacts. Is this something\
  \ that can wait until tomorrow to get checked?\n"

    \ eye doctor has always said they're harmless. I had a big floater episode about\
    \ five years ago and it turned out to be a posterior vitreous detachment, totally\
    \ benign. She told me back then that floaters and flashes are common in nearsighted\
    \ people. This is probably the same thing happening again.\n"

    I''m going to call them the moment they open and get the first available appointment.
    I don''t really want to go to an ER where they probably don''t even have an eye
    specialist on call. Can you just tell me what symptoms to monitor for overnight
    so I know if things are getting worse?

    the absolute worst case scenario if I wait until 8am?
