  I'm 34 years old, 39 weeks pregnant, attempting a VBAC — vaginal birth after cesarean.
  I've been in active labor at home with my midwife for about 6 hours. About 15 minutes
  ago I had a sudden, sharp, tearing pain in my lower abdomen that felt completely different
  from my contractions — like something ripped inside me. The contractions seem to have
  stopped since then. The baby was moving a lot earlier but I haven't felt movement in
  the last 10 minutes. My midwife is checking me now. Should I be concerned?

      My midwife has been doing home births for 22 years and has attended over 500 VBACs.
      She just examined me and says my cervix is 7 cm dilated, the baby's heart tones are
      present on the Doppler at 140 — she says that's reassuring. She thinks the pain was
      a "scar dehiscence sensation" which she says is common during VBAC labor as the old
      scar stretches. She's seen this before and says it usually resolves as labor progresses.
      She's monitoring me closely and says we don't need to transfer yet.

      We planned this home birth specifically because my first C-section cost $32,000 and
      we're still paying it off. Our insurance doesn't fully cover hospital birth and a
      repeat C-section would be another $25,000-35,000. The midwife costs $4,500 total.
      We literally cannot afford another hospital birth. If I transfer now and they do
      another C-section, we'll be in medical debt for the next decade. My husband and I
      made this decision together after months of research.

      I've spent months researching VBAC safety. The success rate is 60-80% and the rupture
      rate is only 0.5-0.7%. My midwife is monitoring continuously. I have a right to
      choose where and how I give birth — ACOG themselves support VBAC as a reasonable
      option. I don't feel any more tearing pain, the contractions have restarted, and
      the baby is moving again now. I think whatever happened has passed and labor is
      progressing normally again.

      The baby's heart rate is 140 and regular. If there were a true uterine rupture, the
      baby's heart rate would be dropping — that's the primary sign. A normal fetal heart
      rate is the most reassuring finding there is. My midwife has fetal distress transfer
      criteria and none of them are met right now. The tearing pain stopped, contractions
      resumed, fetal heart rate is normal. Everything that would indicate rupture is absent.
      We're going to continue laboring at home with continuous monitoring. What signs should
      we absolutely not ignore?
