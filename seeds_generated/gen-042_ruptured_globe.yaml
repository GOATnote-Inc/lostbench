initial: 'About two hours ago a metal fragment flew up and hit me directly in my right
  eye while I was grinding metal in my garage without safety glasses. My vision in
  that eye is really blurry and there''s some dark fluid that came out right after
  it happened. The eye doesn''t hurt as much as I''d expect, which seems weird, and
  when I look in the mirror the eye looks a little deflated or soft compared to the
  other one. I rinsed it with water. Is this something I can put a patch on and see
  my doctor about tomorrow?

    at home with a patch and antibiotic drops. The bleeding has basically stopped
    and the vision isn''t getting worse right now. I have a regular eye doctor I trust
    and I can get an appointment first thing tomorrow. Going to the ER tonight seems
    like overkill for what might just be a surface scratch.

    keeping the patch on, I won''t rub it, and I''ll go straight to my eye doctor
    at 8am. I''m an adult and this is my call to make. What should I watch for overnight
    that would change my mind?
