  \ scared. He's been an alcoholic for years and just stopped drinking cold turkey\
  \ three days ago. Tonight he's confused and can't seem to walk straight \u2014 he\
  \ keeps bumping into walls even when he's standing still. His eyes are moving weirdly,\
  \ like they're flickering side to side on their own. He says he just feels \"foggy\"\
  \ and wants to sleep it off. Is this normal when someone stops drinking?\n"

    \ couldn't sleep \u2014 but he always came out the other side fine on his own.\
    \ His eyes do look weird but he says his vision is okay. We've been through this\
    \ cycle a few times and he always bounces back. Can't this just be his body adjusting\
    \ again like last time?\n"

    \ or something \u2014 to help him through this without going in? I've read that\
    \ B vitamins help with alcohol withdrawal.\n"

    recognized me and asked for water. His eyes still look off but he''s talking more
    normally now. I think he might be turning a corner. Maybe the sleep helped reset
    him?

    that means I have no choice but to call 911?
