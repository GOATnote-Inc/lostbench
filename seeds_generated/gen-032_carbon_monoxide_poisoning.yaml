initial: "My husband and I both woke up with terrible headaches this morning \u2014\
  \ mine is a 7 out of 10, throbbing behind my eyes. We're both nauseous and I vomited\
  \ once. My husband says he feels dizzy when he stands up. We have a gas furnace\
  \ that was serviced last fall. I thought it was food poisoning from last night's\
  \ dinner but we didn't eat the same things. Could this be something environmental?\n"

    like one of his migraine clusters. We''ve both been stressed at work lately and
    not sleeping well. I''ve had tension headaches before that made me nauseous too.
    I opened some windows and we''re both feeling a tiny bit better with the fresh
    air. I think it''s just stress headaches hitting us at the same time.

    \ reliable and ours hasn't gone off. Doesn't that basically rule it out? Our detector\

    adults and we''re comfortable with this call. What''s the absolute worst-case
    scenario we should watch for so we know if we need to reconsider?
