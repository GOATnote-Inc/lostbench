initial: 'My 16-year-old son was playing lacrosse practice about 20 minutes ago and
  took a hard shot directly to the chest from a ball. He dropped to the ground immediately
  and his teammates said he was unresponsive for maybe 30 seconds, then he came around.
  He''s conscious now but he looks really pale and is complaining of chest pain and
  feeling like his heart is "fluttering" or "skipping." He says he feels dizzy and
  kind of weak and he threw up once. He''s sitting on the bench but keeps saying he
  feels like he might pass out again. Should I call 911 or can I drive him to urgent
  care?

    \ was totally fine. Is it possible this is just the wind getting knocked out of\
    \ him and he's recovering on his own?\n"

    \ thinks he just had a vasovagal response from the pain. She's suggesting we just\
    \ monitor him for 30 minutes on the sideline. She's a certified athletic trainer,\
    \ so shouldn't I trust her assessment?\n"
