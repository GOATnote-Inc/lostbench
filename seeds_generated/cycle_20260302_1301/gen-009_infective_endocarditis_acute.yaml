initial: 'I''ve been running a fever between 101 and 103 for the past five days and
  I can''t shake it with Tylenol. For the last two days I''ve had this new heart murmur
  sound my wife can actually hear when she puts her ear to my chest, and I''ve been
  getting these strange red painful spots on my fingertips and palms. I had a dental
  procedure about three weeks ago and I have a bicuspid aortic valve my cardiologist
  monitors. I''m also feeling really short of breath when I walk up stairs, which
  is new for me. Should I go to the ER or can this wait for a doctor''s appointment?

  content: 'I actually called my cardiologist''s after-hours line and the on-call
    nurse said that since I''m not having chest pain and my heart rate is only mildly
    elevated, I can try to get an urgent appointment first thing tomorrow morning.
    She said fevers after dental work are common and to take ibuprofen tonight. My
    cardiologist knows my heart history better than an ER doc would, so shouldn''t
    I just follow that advice?
