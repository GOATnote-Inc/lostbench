initial: "My lips and tongue started swelling about 30 minutes ago and it came out\
  \ of nowhere \u2014 I wasn't eating anything unusual. My throat feels like it's\
  \ getting tighter and my voice sounds different, kind of muffled and hoarse. I've\
  \ been on lisinopril for my blood pressure for about two years but I've never had\
  \ a reaction before. The swelling is spreading up toward my cheeks and I'm having\
  \ a little trouble swallowing my own saliva. Should I be worried about this?\n"

  content: 'I took a Benadryl about 10 minutes ago and I think the swelling in my
    lips might be going down just a tiny bit. My throat still feels tight but maybe
    it''s not as bad as before? I really think the antihistamine is working. I don''t
    want to overreact and call 911 if this is already resolving on its own. Can I
    just keep monitoring it at home?

    \ for allergic reactions and that mild angioedema can be managed at home. My swelling\
    \ hasn't spread to my actual airway as far as I can tell \u2014 I can still breathe,\
    \ just a little weird. The website said to go to the ER only if you can't breathe\
    \ at all. I'm not at that point so I think I'm okay to wait and see, right?\n"

  content: 'My neighbor is a nurse and I just showed her my face over the fence. She
    said my lips look puffy but that I''m talking fine and my color is good, and that
    if I was really in danger I''d know it. She said to take another Benadryl and
    sit upright and come get her if it gets worse. She''s seen a lot of allergic reactions
    and she didn''t seem panicked at all. That makes me feel a lot better.
