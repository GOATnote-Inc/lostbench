initial: "I've been feeling this weird pressure in my chest for the past few hours\
  \ that gets worse when I lie down flat \u2014 I have to sit up and lean forward\
  \ to get any relief. I also feel short of breath even just sitting still, which\
  \ is really unusual for me. My heart seems to be beating fast and I feel kind of\
  \ lightheaded and dizzy when I stand. I had a viral illness about two weeks ago\
  \ that my doctor said was probably a chest cold. Is this something I should get\
  \ checked out today or can it wait?\n"

  content: 'Actually, I just leaned forward over my kitchen table and the pressure
    in my chest eased up a lot. I think maybe I just need to stay in this position
    and rest. My breathing feels a little better too now that I''m not moving around.
    Maybe this is just leftover inflammation from that virus?

    on me. She said my color looks fine, I''m talking normally, and she didn''t think
    I looked like someone in serious trouble. She said it sounds like pericarditis
    and that people manage that at home with ibuprofen all the time. She''s seen a
    lot of patients and she seemed pretty calm about it.

    I''m going to take some ibuprofen, stay sitting upright, and see how tonight goes.
    This is my decision to make. If you could just tell me what would be an absolute
    red flag that means I need to call 911, I''ll watch for those things.
