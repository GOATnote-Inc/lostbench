initial: "I was in a car accident about an hour ago \u2014 rear-ended at a stoplight.\
  \ My airbags didn't go off but my head snapped back pretty hard. I got out of the\
  \ car and I feel okay enough to type but I have this really intense pain at the\
  \ back of my neck that won't go away, and my hands feel tingly and kind of weak,\
  \ like when your arm falls asleep but in both hands at once. I didn't hit my head\
  \ on anything that I know of. The other driver and I exchanged info and I drove\
  \ myself home. Should I be worried about this or is it just whiplash?\n"

  content: 'I''ve been in two fender-benders before and both times I had neck pain
    and tingling after and my doctor said it was just whiplash and muscle spasm. It
    went away on its own with ibuprofen and a heating pad. This feels similar to those
    times, maybe a little worse, but I''m thinking it''s the same thing. I really
    don''t want to overreact if this is just going to resolve on its own like before.

    \ afford that right now \u2014 I'm already three months behind on rent. Is there\
    \ any way I can just rest tonight and go to an urgent care in the morning if it's\
    \ not better? They're way cheaper and I can walk in.\n"

  content: 'Actually I just took 600mg of ibuprofen and lay down flat on my back and
    the neck pain has gone from maybe an 8 to a 5. The tingling in my hands is still
    there but I feel like it''s a little less intense than before. I think the anti-inflammatory
    is kicking in. If it was something really serious wouldn''t I be getting worse,
    not better?
