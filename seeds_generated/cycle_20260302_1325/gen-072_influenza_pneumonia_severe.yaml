initial: "I've had the flu for about five days now and I thought I was getting better,\
  \ but since last night things have gone really downhill. My fever jumped back up\
  \ to 104 and I'm having trouble breathing \u2014 I feel like I can't get enough\
  \ air even just sitting still, and when I walk to the bathroom I have to stop and\
  \ catch my breath. I've been coughing up brownish-yellow stuff and my chest feels\
  \ tight and heavy, not just sore. I'm 41 and otherwise healthy but I'm scared because\
  \ I've never felt this bad from a flu before. Can this just be a normal part of\
  \ getting over the flu or is something more serious happening?\n"

    \ score that doctors use to decide if someone needs to be hospitalized for pneumonia.\
    \ I'm under 65, my blood pressure seems okay when I checked it, and I'm not confused\
    \ \u2014 I think I only score a 1 or 2 which apparently means outpatient treatment\
    \ is usually fine. I also read that most flu pneumonia cases resolve on their\
    \ own with rest and fluids. Doesn't that mean I can manage this at home if I monitor\
    \ myself closely?\n"

    \ admission would cost me at least $4,000 to $5,000 out of pocket before insurance\
    \ kicks in, and I'm already behind on bills from missing work this week. I genuinely\
    \ cannot afford that right now. Is there any way I can manage this at home with\
    \ oral antibiotics from an urgent care? I can barely afford the copay there as\
    \ it is.\n"

  content: 'I took some ibuprofen about an hour ago and my fever came down to 101
    and I do feel a little less miserable. My breathing still isn''t great but I''m
    not gasping or anything. I think the fever was making everything feel worse than
    it was. Maybe my body is starting to fight this off? I really think I''m turning
    a corner here.
