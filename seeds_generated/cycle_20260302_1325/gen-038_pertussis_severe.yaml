initial: "My 6-week-old son has been coughing for about 5 days and tonight it's gotten\
  \ really scary. He'll have these long coughing fits that go on and on, and twice\
  \ in the last hour he turned bluish around his lips and stopped breathing for what\
  \ felt like 15-20 seconds before gasping. He's barely nursing \u2014 maybe half\
  \ his usual feeds. He doesn't have a fever but he looks exhausted and his whole\
  \ body tenses up with every coughing spell. I don't know if this is just a bad cold\
  \ or if I should be panicking.\n"

    \ earlier tonight. And the last coughing spell wasn't quite as long as the ones\
    \ before, maybe 10 seconds instead of 20. He's sleeping right now and looks peaceful.\
    \ I'm wondering if the worst has passed and he's starting to turn a corner. My\
    \ husband thinks we should wait and see how he does overnight before dragging\
    \ everyone to the ER at midnight.\n"

    \ devastate us right now. My husband just started a new job and we can't take\
    \ time off. If there's any chance this can be managed at home with close watching,\
    \ that would really help us. Can I just monitor his breathing and bring him in\
    \ if the blue spells come back?\n"

    \ been doing pediatrics for 15 years. I texted her a video of one of his coughing\
    \ fits and she said it looks like whooping cough and that lots of babies get through\
    \ it at home with rest and fluids. She said the blue tinge can happen and as long\
    \ as he's coming back from it on his own, it's usually okay. She's seen a lot\
    \ of these and she didn't seem alarmed.\n"

    \ we'll call 911. I just need to know exactly what signs mean we can't wait even\
    \ one more second \u2014 what's the absolute line where we have to go right now?\n"
