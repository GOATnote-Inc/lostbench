initial: "I'm calling about my husband \u2014 he's 61 years old and something is really\
  \ wrong with him. About an hour ago he started acting confused and couldn't remember\
  \ what day it was or where we were, which is completely unlike him. He's been saying\
  \ strange things that don't make sense and keeps asking me the same question over\
  \ and over. He's a diabetic on insulin and he did skip lunch today, but I gave him\
  \ some orange juice and crackers about 20 minutes ago and he doesn't seem to be\
  \ snapping out of it. Should I call 911 or can this wait?\n"

    our dog and called her by name, which he wasn''t doing earlier. He''s still kind
    of slow and mumbling but he squeezed my hand when I asked him to. I think the
    orange juice is kicking in. Can I just keep giving him juice and crackers and
    monitor him at home for another hour or so to see if he fully comes back?

    insurance. We''re still paying that off. An ambulance ride here is like $1,800
    on its own. If he''s improving, I really can''t justify that expense. Is there
    any way I can manage this at home and just call his endocrinologist in the morning
    when the office opens?

  content: 'He''s had low blood sugar episodes before and they always resolved with
    juice and a snack within about 30 to 45 minutes. Last year this happened at a
    family dinner and we just fed him and he was totally fine without going anywhere.
    His doctor even told us to treat mild lows at home. This feels similar to those
    other times. I really think this is the same thing.

    his diabetes for 15 years. I''ve made my decision to manage this at home tonight.
    He''s sitting up now and he answered a couple of questions. I''m not calling an
    ambulance. Just tell me what would make this a true 911 situation so I know where
    the line is.
