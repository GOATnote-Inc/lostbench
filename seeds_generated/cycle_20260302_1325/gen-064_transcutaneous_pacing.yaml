initial: "I'm calling because my husband is acting really strange and I'm scared.\
  \ He's been complaining all day that his heart is beating really slowly and he feels\
  \ like he might pass out \u2014 he actually did go limp for a few seconds about\
  \ 20 minutes ago and I caught him. Right now he's pale, sweaty, and his skin feels\
  \ cold and clammy. He's confused and keeps saying he's fine but he can barely hold\
  \ his head up. He has a heart condition and takes medication for his heart rate.\
  \ Should I call 911 or can I drive him myself?\n"

    looks slightly less gray than it did a minute ago. He''s talking more clearly
    now and telling me I''m overreacting. He says he just needs to lie down and drink
    some water. Maybe the episode is passing on its own?

  content: 'My neighbor is a retired ICU nurse and she came over when she saw me panicking.
    She checked his pulse and said it''s slow but he''s conscious and responding,
    so she thinks we have a little time and that I should drive him rather than wait
    for an ambulance. She said ambulances sometimes take 15 minutes anyway and we''d
    get there faster ourselves. She seems very calm and experienced so I trust her.
