initial: 'I was cooking and a pot of boiling water tipped over and splashed across
  my chest and stomach about 20 minutes ago. The skin looks really red and there are
  some blisters forming, and the area is maybe the size of both my hands put together.
  It hurt a lot at first but now it''s starting to feel kind of numb, which I think
  means it''s calming down. I ran cold water over it for a few minutes and put some
  butter on it like my grandmother used to do. Do I really need to go to the ER for
  a scald burn?

  content: 'I looked up burn severity online and it says second-degree burns are the
    ones with blisters, and that minor second-degree burns under 3 inches can be treated
    at home. I measured and the blistered part is maybe 4 or 5 inches across. That
    seems close enough to the home treatment range. I also read that the ER will just
    clean it and wrap it, which I can do myself. Why would I spend hundreds of dollars
    for someone to do what I can do here?
