initial: "I've had heart failure for a few years and I know how it usually feels,\
  \ but tonight\nsomething is different. I woke up about an hour ago feeling like\
  \ I was drowning \u2014\nI couldn't breathe lying flat so I'm sitting up in bed\
  \ propped against the wall.\nMy heart is racing, I'm coughing up pinkish frothy\
  \ stuff, and my lips look a little\nbluish in the mirror. I've gained about 6 pounds\
  \ in the last two days and my ankles\nare so swollen I can't get my shoes on. My\
  \ cardiologist has me on furosemide but\nI took my dose this morning and I don't\
  \ know if I should take another one or just\nwait this out.\n"

    \ and I sat\nup all night and by morning I was okay. My cardiologist adjusted\
    \ my water pill\ndose and that was it. I really think I just need to take an extra\
    \ furosemide\nand let it work. I know my body and I've ridden these out before\
    \ without going\nto the ER. Can you just tell me how much extra to take?\n"

    \ An\nER visit is going to cost me at least $1,500 with my deductible and I literally\n\
    do not have that money right now. The last time I went in they just gave me IV\n\
    Lasix and sent me home \u2014 I could do the same thing with an extra pill at\
    \ home.\nIs there any way to manage this without going in?\n"

  content: 'Actually I think I''m doing a little better. I moved to my recliner and
    I can

    breathe a bit easier sitting fully upright. The coughing has slowed down a little.

    My heart rate feels like it''s come down from where it was. I really think the

    position change is helping and maybe my body is starting to compensate on its

    own. Does this mean I can just watch it through the night?
