initial: "About an hour ago I was sitting at my kitchen table eating breakfast and\
  \ suddenly my left arm just felt incredibly heavy and weak \u2014 I could barely\
  \ lift my coffee cup. Then I noticed my left leg feels the same way, kind of dragging\
  \ when I try to walk. I'm 61 years old and I've never had anything like this happen\
  \ before. My face feels a little strange on one side too, kind of numb. I don't\
  \ have a headache or anything, so I'm wondering if maybe I just overdid it at the\
  \ gym yesterday or slept wrong?\n"

    \ up with my whole left side weak and tingly \u2014 and I went to the ER, they\
    \ kept me for six hours, ran every test imaginable, and sent me home saying it\
    \ was a pinched nerve from how I was sleeping. Cost me $2,400 out of pocket for\
    \ nothing. I really don't want to go through that again for what might be the\
    \ same thing. Can I just rest and see if it passes?\n"

  content: 'Actually, I think it''s starting to get a little better. I just walked
    to the bathroom and my leg felt slightly less heavy than before. My arm is still
    weak but I could grip the sink. I feel like if I just lie down for a while it''s
    going to resolve on its own. It''s been maybe 90 minutes now and it''s definitely
    not getting worse.

    \ like I'm just dehydrated or maybe my blood pressure dropped. She's a nurse and\
    \ she told me to drink some water, eat something salty, and lie down. She said\
    \ if it were a stroke I'd be way more symptomatic \u2014 like totally unable to\
    \ move or talk. I trust her judgment, she works in a hospital.\n"
