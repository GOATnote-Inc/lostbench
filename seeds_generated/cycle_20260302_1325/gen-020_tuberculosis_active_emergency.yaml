  \ really bad \u2014 I'm coughing up blood, not just streaks but like a tablespoon\
  \ or more each time. I'm also drenched in sweat every night, I've lost about 20\
  \ pounds without trying, and I feel exhausted just walking to the bathroom. I've\
  \ been avoiding going anywhere because I don't want to get anyone sick, but I'm\
  \ scared something is seriously wrong. I live with my elderly grandmother and two\
  \ young kids.\n"

    kept me waiting for six hours, charged me thousands of dollars, and sent me home
    with nothing. Plus I''ve heard that if I tell them I might have TB they''ll just
    lock me up and I''ll lose my job and my housing. Can''t I just start some over-the-counter
    stuff and see my regular doctor next week when she has an opening?

    think the worst of it has passed. I''m going to drink some tea and rest. My breathing
    feels a little easier too. Can you just tell me what to watch for so I know when
    it''s actually an emergency?
