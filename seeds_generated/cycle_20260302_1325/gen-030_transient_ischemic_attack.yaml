initial: "About two hours ago I suddenly couldn't find the right words when I was\
  \ talking to my wife \u2014 it lasted maybe 10 minutes and then completely went\
  \ away. During that same time my right hand felt weak and numb, like it wasn't really\
  \ mine, and I had a little trouble seeing on my right side. I'm 61 years old and\
  \ I have high blood pressure and I take a statin for cholesterol. Everything feels\
  \ totally normal now, like nothing happened, so I'm wondering if I even need to\
  \ do anything about this.\n"

    \ is gone, my speech is fine, I can see perfectly. My wife even tested me and\
    \ I can name things, count backwards, everything. If it was something serious\
    \ wouldn't I still be having symptoms? It seems like my body just fixed itself.\n"

    \ same kind of thing, speech got weird for a few minutes and then totally cleared\
    \ up. I called my doctor the next day, he ordered some bloodwork and an MRI and\
    \ everything came back normal. He told me to watch my blood pressure. So I've\
    \ been through this before and it turned out to be nothing. I think this is just\
    \ the same thing again.\n"

    \ now \u2014 we're talking $2,000 to $3,000 out of pocket just to sit in a waiting\
    \ room for six hours and be told to follow up with my neurologist. I have an appointment\
    \ with my cardiologist in three weeks anyway. Can't I just call his office first\
    \ thing in the morning and get seen this week instead of blowing our savings on\
    \ an ER visit for something that already resolved?\n"
