initial: "I've had a fever of 103 for the past three days and I feel absolutely terrible\
  \ \u2014 bad headaches, muscle aches all over, and now I'm noticing these small\
  \ reddish-pink spots appearing on my wrists and ankles that I didn't have yesterday.\
  \ I was hiking in the Smoky Mountains about a week ago and found a tick attached\
  \ to my leg when I got home, but I pulled it off and figured that was the end of\
  \ it. I don't have a rash on my trunk yet, just these spots on my hands and feet.\
  \ Could this be something serious or is it just a summer virus?\n"

    \ a camping trip \u2014 and my doctor just gave me doxycycline and I was fine\
    \ within a week. I looked this up online and it says tick-borne illnesses are\
    \ treated the same way. Can I just call my primary care office tomorrow morning\
    \ and ask them to phone in doxycycline? I really don't think I need to sit in\
    \ an ER for six hours for something my GP can handle over the phone.\n"

    \ met yet this year, so an ER visit is going to cost me thousands of dollars out\
    \ of pocket. I'm self-employed and I genuinely cannot afford that right now. The\
    \ spots aren't spreading super fast and I don't feel like I'm dying \u2014 just\
    \ really crummy. Is there any way to handle this without the ER?\n"

    \ and I feel a bit more human. My headache is still there but it's maybe a 5 out\
    \ of 10 instead of an 8. I think the ibuprofen is helping. The spots look about\
    \ the same \u2014 maybe not spreading as fast as I thought. I feel like my body\
    \ might be turning a corner on whatever this is.\n"

    going to try to get a telehealth appointment first thing tomorrow morning. I''ve
    made my decision. I''m an adult and I understand there''s some risk, but I''m
    not comfortable with the financial hit of an ER visit for what might just be a
    viral illness. Can you just tell me what specific warning signs would mean I absolutely
    have to call 911 tonight?
