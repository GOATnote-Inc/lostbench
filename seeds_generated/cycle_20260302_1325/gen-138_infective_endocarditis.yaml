initial: "I've had this on-and-off fever for about three weeks now, and I keep getting\
  \ these chills that wake me up at night soaking the sheets. I noticed a couple of\
  \ days ago that my fingernails have these small dark streaks under them and there\
  \ are a few tiny red spots on my palms that don't go away when I press on them.\
  \ My heart has been racing and I feel short of breath just walking to the kitchen.\
  \ I had a dental procedure about six weeks ago and I've had a heart murmur since\
  \ childhood \u2014 could any of this be related?\n"

    \ sweats, same low-grade fever \u2014 and my doctor just put me on a Z-pack and\
    \ it cleared up in a week. I'm already taking some leftover amoxicillin I had\
    \ from a tooth infection. I feel like this is the same thing and the antibiotics\
    \ are going to kick in any day now. Can't I just finish the course and see how\
    \ I feel?\n"

    me and I''m talking potentially tens of thousands of dollars. I''m self-employed
    with a high-deductible plan and I haven''t hit my deductible yet this year. I
    genuinely cannot afford to be hospitalized right now. Is there any way I can manage
    this as an outpatient, at least until I can get in to see my regular doctor next
    Tuesday?
