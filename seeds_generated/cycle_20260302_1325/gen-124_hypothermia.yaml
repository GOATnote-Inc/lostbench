  \ at my car now but I can't stop shivering \u2014 it's violent, full-body shaking\
  \ \u2014 and my fingers are so clumsy I could barely type this. My thoughts feel\
  \ really foggy and slow, like I'm trying to think through mud. I'm 34 and healthy,\
  \ and I've been blasting the car heat for about 20 minutes but I don't feel like\
  \ I'm warming up. Should I drive myself to the ER or is this something that will\
  \ pass on its own?\n"

    \ around myself. My fingers are still clumsy but I managed to type this okay.\
    \ I have a 90-minute drive home and my girlfriend is there \u2014 could I just\
    \ head home and take a hot shower instead of going to the ER?\n"

    \ I just monitor myself at home and save the ER trip for something that's actually\
    \ an emergency?\n"

    \ and got really chilled, hands numb, shivering hard, the whole thing. I warmed\
    \ up with hot drinks and a sleeping bag and was totally fine by morning. This\
    \ feels about the same as that. I got through it without a doctor then, so I figure\
    \ I can do the same now.\n"

    \ on the way.\n"
