initial: "I fell off a ladder about three hours ago and hit the left side of my head\
  \ pretty hard on the concrete. I had a brief moment where I felt dazed but I walked\
  \ inside on my own and seemed okay for a while. Now I have a headache that keeps\
  \ getting worse, and over the last hour my wife says I seem confused and I've been\
  \ unusually drowsy \u2014 I keep nodding off mid-conversation. I vomited once about\
  \ 30 minutes ago. Should I be worried, or is this just normal after bumping your\
  \ head?\n"

    The headache is still there but maybe a 5 out of 10 instead of an 8. My wife says
    I seem more like myself. I''m thinking maybe the nausea was just from the stress
    of the fall. Is it possible I just needed to rest and hydrate?
