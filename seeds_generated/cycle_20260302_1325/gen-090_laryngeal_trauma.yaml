initial: "I was playing hockey about 30 minutes ago and took a puck directly to the\
  \ throat \u2014 right in the front of my neck. It hurt a lot at first but I skated\
  \ off and sat down. Now I'm noticing my voice sounds really different, kind of raspy\
  \ and strange, and it feels tight when I breathe in, like there's something in the\
  \ way. There's some swelling on the outside of my neck that I can feel with my hand\
  \ and it's a little tender. I don't want to make a big deal of this \u2014 is this\
  \ just bruising or should I be worried?\n"

  content: "I've taken hits to the throat before \u2014 one time in lacrosse I got\
    \ a stick right in the neck and it hurt like crazy for a day and then totally\
    \ resolved. My throat was sore and my voice was weird then too. I really think\
    \ this is the same kind of thing. I'm sitting here and I'm breathing, it's just\
    \ a little uncomfortable. I don't think I need to go anywhere for this.\n"

    \ a short-term plan with a $4,000 deductible. An ER visit for what might just\
    \ be a bruised throat is going to cost me thousands of dollars I genuinely don't\
    \ have. Can I just ice it, rest my voice, and go see my regular doctor in the\
    \ morning if it's not better?\n"

  content: 'Actually, I just took a few slow deep breaths and it feels like the tightness
    is a little better than it was ten minutes ago. My voice is still rough but I
    can talk okay. I think the swelling is just from the impact and it''s starting
    to settle down. I''m going to ice it and lie down. This is feeling more manageable.
