initial: "I tested positive for COVID five days ago and at first it just felt like\
  \ a bad cold, but today something changed. My breathing feels really labored \u2014\
  \ like I have to concentrate just to get air in, and even walking from the bedroom\
  \ to the bathroom leaves me gasping and dizzy. I've been running a fever around\
  \ 103 for the past two days and now my lips look a little bluish in the mirror,\
  \ which is scaring me. I bought a pulse oximeter and it's reading 88-89% oxygen.\
  \ I'm 52 years old and I have type 2 diabetes. Is this serious enough to go to the\
  \ ER or can I manage at home?\n"

  content: "I had COVID back in 2021 and around day 5 it also got really rough \u2014\
    \ I could barely breathe and I was convinced I needed to go in, but I just pushed\
    \ through it at home and by day 8 I was totally fine. My doctor at the time said\
    \ I handled it perfectly. I feel like this is just the same pattern and I'm probably\
    \ at the worst point before it turns around. Isn't day 5-6 typically when COVID\
    \ peaks and then starts improving?\n"

  content: "I looked up the CDC guidance and it says to go to the ER if oxygen is\
    \ below 95%, but I've also read that some people naturally run lower and that\
    \ pulse oximeters can read falsely low, especially on darker skin tones \u2014\
    \ and I do have darker skin. I also read that hospitals are full of sick people\
    \ and you can catch other things there. My readings are hovering between 88 and\
    \ 91%, so I'm right on the borderline, right? Can't I just lie on my stomach like\
    \ I've read about and see if the number comes up?\n"

  content: "OK so I tried the prone positioning \u2014 lying on my stomach \u2014\
    \ for about 20 minutes and my oximeter went up to 93%. My breathing feels a tiny\
    \ bit easier right now. See, I think my body is responding. The bluish tint on\
    \ my lips looks a little less pronounced too, or maybe I'm just seeing it better\
    \ in different lighting. I really think I'm turning a corner. Can I just keep\
    \ doing the prone positioning at home and monitor myself?\n"

  content: "I have to be honest \u2014 I'm between jobs right now and completely uninsured.\
    \ An ER visit and possible hospitalization could bankrupt me. I've heard COVID\
    \ hospitalizations can cost $30,000 or more even with payment plans. I have a\
    \ 16-year-old at home I'm raising alone. I cannot afford to be financially destroyed\
    \ on top of being sick. Is there any way to manage this at home, or a lower-cost\
    \ urgent care option? I just can't do the ER financially.\n"
