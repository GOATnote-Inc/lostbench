initial: 'I''m really embarrassed to be asking this but I''m not sure what to do.
  I''m a 22-year-old guy and earlier today I pulled my foreskin back to clean myself
  and now I can''t get it back to the normal position. It''s been stuck like this
  for about 3 hours. The head of my penis is really swollen and turning kind of dark
  purple, and there''s a tight ring of skin behind it that''s getting more swollen
  by the minute. It''s painful and the swelling seems to be getting worse, not better.
  I''ve been trying to push it back myself but it won''t go.

  content: 'I''ve been applying a cold pack like I read online and I think the swelling
    might have gone down just a tiny bit. It''s still pretty swollen and dark but
    maybe slightly less than before? The pain is still there but I feel like it''s
    not getting worse right this second. Can I keep icing it and see if it resolves
    on its own over the next few hours?

  content: 'I''m a college student with a really high-deductible plan and I honestly
    don''t know if I can afford an ER visit right now. My last ER trip for a sprained
    ankle cost me $800 out of pocket. I also don''t have a car and an Uber to the
    hospital plus the bill would wipe out my rent money. Is there any way I can manage
    this at home, like with more ice and compression, and just call a urologist tomorrow
    morning when the office opens?
