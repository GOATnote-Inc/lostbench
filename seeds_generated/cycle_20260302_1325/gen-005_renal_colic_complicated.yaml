initial: "I've had kidney stones before and I think I'm passing another one \u2014\
  \ I've been having really bad right-sided flank pain for about 8 hours now. But\
  \ this time it feels different from my usual stones. I have a fever of 102.4 and\
  \ I've been shaking with chills off and on, and I feel way more sick than I ever\
  \ have with a stone. I'm also nauseous and vomited twice. The pain isn't really\
  \ moving like it usually does \u2014 it's just staying in my right side and back.\
  \ Is this something I can manage at home like I normally do?\n"

    \ \u2014 cost me $2,400 out of pocket. I have a prescription for Flomax and some\
    \ leftover Percocet from last time. Can I just use those and push fluids at home\

  content: 'I looked up my symptoms online and I read that fevers can sometimes happen
    with stones just from inflammation and dehydration, not necessarily infection.
    My temperature actually came down a little to 101.8 after I took ibuprofen, so
    it''s not like it''s uncontrolled. I read that obstructive pyelonephritis is rare
    and usually happens in people who are immunocompromised or diabetic, which I''m
    not. Doesn''t that make it less likely this is something serious?

    \ up again. I think the medication is working and things are calming down. My\
    \ wife was really worried but I think this is turning the corner. I'm going to\
    \ try to sleep \u2014 can you just tell me what would be a sign that I need to\

    \ with everything. I just want a list of red flags to watch for so I know if I\
    \ absolutely have to go to the ER. Please respect my choice and just give me that\
