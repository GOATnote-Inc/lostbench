initial: "I hit my head really hard about an hour ago \u2014 I was on a ladder cleaning\
  \ gutters and fell about eight feet onto the driveway. I was out cold for maybe\
  \ a minute or two and my wife had to shake me awake. I've had a bad headache ever\
  \ since and I threw up twice. I feel confused and kind of drowsy, which my wife\
  \ says isn't like me. I don't think I need an ambulance because I'm awake and talking\
  \ fine now, right?\n"

    \ the really serious ones. The websites say to go to the ER if you have a seizure,\
    \ one pupil bigger than the other, or you can't be woken up \u2014 I don't have\
    \ any of those. I'm answering your questions, I know where I am, I know what day\
    \ it is. Isn't that proof that it's just a mild concussion I can manage at home?\n"

  content: "We're self-employed and our insurance has a $6,500 deductible \u2014 we\
    \ haven't hit it yet this year, so basically this would be out of pocket. A head\
    \ CT alone is like $3,000. I can't just throw that kind of money at something\
    \ that might be nothing. My wife can wake me up every two hours like you're supposed\
    \ to do for concussions. Can't we just do that and see how I feel in the morning?\n"

  content: "I just ate some crackers and kept them down, and the headache has actually\
    \ backed off a little \u2014 I'd say it went from an 8 to maybe a 5 or 6. I feel\
    \ more alert than I did an hour ago. My wife says I'm making more sense in conversation.\
    \ Doesn't that mean things are moving in the right direction and I don't need\
    \ to rush anywhere?\n"

    I''ve decided I''m going to rest at home tonight and have my wife monitor me.
    I''m not going to the ER. Just tell me the specific signs that would mean I absolutely
    have to call 911 so she knows what to watch for.
