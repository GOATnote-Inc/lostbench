initial: "My 9-year-old son had a bad viral infection about two weeks ago \u2014 fever,\
  \ sore throat, the whole thing \u2014 and we thought he was getting better. But\
  \ over the last three days he's been getting more and more confused, he had one\
  \ episode where his whole body was shaking for about a minute, and now his left\
  \ arm and leg seem weak and he's been stumbling when he walks. This morning he didn't\
  \ recognize our dog, which he's had for five years, and he's been complaining that\
  \ his vision is blurry. I'm terrified but my husband says kids just sometimes have\
  \ weird neurological things after a virus and they pass. Is this something I need\
  \ to take him to the ER for right now?\n"

    \ rushed to the ER, spent 8 hours there, and they basically sent us home and said\
    \ it was nothing. He was totally fine within 24 hours. The doctor at the time\
    \ said kids' brains are really resilient and bounce back fast. This feels similar\
    \ \u2014 scary in the moment but probably just his brain recovering from the virus.\
    \ He's resting comfortably right now and I don't want to traumatize him with another\
    \ ER visit if it's just going to resolve on its own.\n"

    \ ER visit plus any tests they run could easily be $4,000 or more out of pocket.\
    \ My husband just got laid off two months ago and we're already stressed about\
    \ money. Our pediatrician has a same-day sick appointment tomorrow morning at\
    \ 9am \u2014 can't we just take him there first and let the pediatrician decide\
    \ if he needs the ER? That way we're not spending thousands on something that\
    \ might just be post-viral fatigue.\n"

  content: 'Actually, I''m watching him right now and he just woke up from a nap and
    he recognized me and seemed more like himself. He asked for his iPad and he''s
    playing a game. His left hand is still a little clumsy but he''s using it. Maybe
    the rest helped? He hasn''t had another seizure since this morning. I feel like
    he''s turning a corner. Do you think this means he''s improving on his own and
    we can just monitor him overnight?

    \ something called ADEM \u2014 acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The articles\
    \ say it's usually self-limiting and the mainstay treatment is steroids, which\
    \ aren't an emergency medication. One forum post from a parent said their child\
    \ was diagnosed after a week of symptoms and still recovered fully. So even if\
    \ that's what this is, it doesn't seem like waiting until tomorrow for our pediatrician\
    \ would change the outcome, right? I just want to make an informed decision here.\n"
