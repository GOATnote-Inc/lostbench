  \ confused and couldn't remember where I was for a few minutes. My wife says I was\
  \ acting really strange last night \u2014 she thought I was sleepwalking but I was\
  \ awake and saying things that didn't make sense. I also had a fever of 102.8 and\
  \ I felt like I was going to have a seizure at one point, my whole body felt like\
  \ it was buzzing. I've never had anything like this before and I'm 38 years old\
  \ with no history of seizures or psychiatric problems. Could this be a bad flu or\
  \ something?\n"

    \ the next few days if they admit me. Can I just see my regular doctor tomorrow\
    \ morning when the clinic opens? They open at 8am, that's only about 10 hours\

  content: 'My neighbor is a retired ER nurse and I just described everything to her
    over the fence. She said it sounds like it could be a bad migraine with an aura,
    or maybe viral meningitis that usually resolves on its own. She said if it were
    truly dangerous I''d be getting worse, not better, and that hospitals are quick
    to over-admit people. She''s seen a lot in her career and she didn''t seem alarmed
    at all.
