initial: "I'm going through chemotherapy for lymphoma \u2014 my last cycle was about\
  \ 10 days ago \u2014 and I woke up this morning feeling terrible. I took my temperature\
  \ and it was 38.4\xB0C (101.1\xB0F). I have this weird shaking chill that came on\
  \ suddenly and I feel completely wiped out, more than my usual chemo fatigue. My\
  \ oncologist told me to watch my temperature carefully but I'm not sure if this\
  \ counts as something I need to act on right now or if I should just rest and monitor\
  \ it.\n"

    \ and it resolved. My oncologist didn't even mention it at my next visit. I really\
    \ feel like this is the same thing \u2014 my body just reacts this way to treatment.\
    \ Is there any reason this time would be different?\n"

  content: 'I genuinely cannot afford another hospitalization right now. My last admission
    for a reaction cost me over $4,000 out of pocket even with insurance, and I''m
    already behind on bills from being out of work during treatment. If I call my
    oncology team they''re going to send me straight to the ER and I''ll end up admitted
    for days. Can I just take some Tylenol, watch my temp, and call the oncology nurse
    line in the morning when they open?

    to 99.6 now. The chills have also calmed down a bit. I think the Tylenol is doing
    its job and my fever is breaking. I''m feeling slightly less awful than I did
    this morning. Doesn''t that mean things are moving in the right direction and
    I can manage this at home?

    been through six cycles of chemo and I know how I feel after treatment. I''ve
    decided I''m going to rest tonight and call my oncology clinic first thing when
    they open at 8am. I just want to know what specific signs would mean I absolutely
    have to go in tonight so I know what to watch for.
