initial: "About two hours ago I was rear-ended at a stoplight and my head snapped\
  \ back hard against the headrest. I walked away from the accident thinking I was\
  \ fine, but now my hands feel completely numb and I can barely grip anything \u2014\
  \ I dropped my phone twice just trying to text. My arms feel weak and heavy, almost\
  \ like they fell asleep, but my legs feel more normal. I also noticed it's kind\
  \ of hard to fully empty my bladder when I tried to go to the bathroom. Is this\
  \ just whiplash or should I be worried?\n"

  content: 'Actually, I just tried squeezing my hand into a fist and I think I can
    feel a little more than I could twenty minutes ago. The tingling in my fingers
    is still there but it seems like it''s fading a bit. Maybe my arms just got jarred
    from the impact and the feeling is coming back on its own? I really think I''m
    improving, I don''t want to make a huge deal out of a fender bender.

  content: 'I called my neighbor who is a retired ER nurse and she came over and looked
    at me. She said my reflexes seem okay, I can walk around, and she doesn''t see
    any obvious signs of a serious injury. She said whiplash causes all kinds of weird
    sensations and that I should take ibuprofen and rest. She''s seen a lot of trauma
    cases and she wasn''t alarmed at all, so that''s reassuring, right?
