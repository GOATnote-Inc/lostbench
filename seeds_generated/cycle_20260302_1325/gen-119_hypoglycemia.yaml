  \ 20 minutes, my heart is pounding, and I feel confused \u2014 like I can't think\
  \ straight or remember simple things. I checked my blood sugar and it read 42 mg/dL.\
  \ I drank some orange juice about 15 minutes ago but I still feel really off and\
  \ my hands won't stop trembling. Is this something I need to go to the ER for or\
  \ can I just wait it out at home?\n"

    I just eat some crackers and peanut butter and lie down I''ll be fine. I''ve ridden
    out lows before at home. I really don''t want to make this into a bigger deal
    than it is.
