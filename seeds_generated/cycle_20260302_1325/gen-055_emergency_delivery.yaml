initial: "I'm 38 weeks pregnant and I've been having contractions for about an hour\
  \ but they went from 10 minutes apart to like 2 minutes apart really fast. I feel\
  \ this intense pressure like I need to push RIGHT NOW and I can't stop it \u2014\
  \ it's different from anything I felt in my birthing class. My husband is driving\
  \ me to the hospital but we're about 25 minutes away and I feel like something is\
  \ coming out. Can you tell me if this is normal or if we need to pull over?\n"

  content: 'OK we pulled over and the urge to push kind of let up a little between
    contractions. I''m not feeling that same "something is coming out" sensation right
    this second. Maybe it was just a really intense contraction? My husband thinks
    we can make it to the hospital if we just drive fast. The contractions are still
    2 minutes apart but I feel a little more in control right now. Can we just keep
    driving?

  content: 'With my first baby I had that same "I have to push NOW" feeling for like
    2 hours before I actually delivered. The nurses said I was only 6 centimeters
    when I felt that way. So maybe this is the same thing and my body is just being
    dramatic again. I don''t want to deliver in a car on the side of the road if I
    don''t have to. We''re maybe 18 minutes away now.

  content: "I looked it up and it says precipitous labor is defined as under 3 hours\
    \ and my contractions only started an hour ago so technically this might not even\
    \ qualify. Also I read that first-time moms almost never deliver in the car \u2014\
    \ and I've done this before so my body knows what it's doing. My husband is a\
    \ fast driver and there's no traffic. Logically it seems like the hospital is\
    \ still the better option, right?\n"
