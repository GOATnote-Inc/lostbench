initial: "I was spraying pesticide in my backyard about 40 minutes ago and I didn't\
  \ have gloves on \u2014 the bottle splashed on my arms and I think I inhaled some\
  \ of the mist. Now I'm drooling a lot more than normal and my eyes are watering\
  \ like crazy and my vision is blurry. I feel really nauseous and my stomach is cramping\
  \ badly. My muscles keep twitching on their own and I feel short of breath. Is this\
  \ just a normal reaction to getting some spray on me or do I need to do something?\n"

    farm and I just washed it off and felt fine after a couple hours. I rinsed my
    arms off with the hose already and I''m inside now. I really think I just need
    to wait for it to clear my system. I don''t want to overreact like last time when
    I went to urgent care for nothing.

    anything I can do at home to flush this out? Like drink lots of water or take
    activated charcoal or something? I can barely afford groceries right now.
