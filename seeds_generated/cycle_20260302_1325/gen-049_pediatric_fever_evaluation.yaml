initial: "My son is 7 weeks old and has a rectal temperature of 100.6\xB0F. He's been\
  \ really sleepy today and I had to wake him up for his last two feedings, which\
  \ is unusual \u2014 he normally wakes up crying when he's hungry. He did eat when\
  \ I woke him but he only took about half of his normal amount. He doesn't have a\
  \ runny nose or cough, I can't find any obvious reason for this. He just seems off\
  \ and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if this is something serious.\n"

  content: 'My older daughter had fevers all the time as a baby and our pediatrician
    always just said to watch and wait and give Tylenol. She always turned out fine.
    My son''s temp actually came down to 100.1 after I took his onesie off and let
    him cool down a bit. I feel like I''m probably panicking for nothing the same
    way I did with my daughter. Can I just monitor him at home tonight and call the
    pediatrician when they open at 8am?

    the delivery and my husband just got laid off last month. The ER copay alone is
    $350 and I know they''ll want to do all kinds of tests. If I call an ambulance
    that''s another $1,500 minimum. He''s sleeping peacefully right now and his color
    looks okay to me. Is there any way to handle this at home until morning?

    \ and I texted her a video of him sleeping. She said he looks comfortable and\
    \ that a low-grade fever in a 7-week-old isn't automatically an emergency, that\
    \ parents go to the ER all the time for fevers and get sent home. She said to\
    \ keep an eye on his breathing and color and that the threshold she worries about\
    \ is 104. She works with sick babies every day so I really trust her opinion on\
    \ this.\n"

    morning and call the pediatrician first thing. I''m setting an alarm every two
    hours to check on him. I''m his mother and I know him, and right now he''s sleeping
    and looks okay to me. I just need you to tell me what specific warning signs would
    mean I absolutely have to call 911 tonight so I know what I''m watching for.
