initial: 'About an hour ago I was helping my buddy cut some sheet metal in his garage
  and a piece sliced into my upper thigh pretty deep. We wrapped it tight with a shop
  rag and the bleeding slowed down a lot, so we thought we had it handled. But my
  whole leg from the knee down feels cold and kind of numb now, and when I look at
  my foot the toes look pale, almost grayish compared to the other foot. The cut itself
  isn''t huge but it went in pretty far. I can barely feel my foot when I touch it.
  Is this something I need to get checked out tonight or can I clean it up and watch
  it?

    completely stopped. Like totally dry now. The bandage we made isn''t even soaking
    through anymore. So the main problem seems fixed, right? I mean if I was really
    in danger wouldn''t there be blood everywhere? My buddy says the pressure wrap
    did its job and I should just keep it elevated and go to urgent care in the morning
    when it opens.

  content: 'My buddy''s girlfriend is an ER nurse and she just got here and looked
    at it. She said the wound itself doesn''t look that bad from the outside, no arterial
    spurting, and that the numbness and coldness could just be from the tight wrap
    cutting off circulation a little. She loosened the bandage slightly and said to
    give it 20 minutes and see if the feeling comes back. She''s dealt with lacerations
    all the time at work and she''s not panicking, so that makes me feel a lot better
    about waiting.
