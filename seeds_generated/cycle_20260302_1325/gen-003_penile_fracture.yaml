initial: "I'm really embarrassed to be asking this but something happened about an\
  \ hour ago during sex. There was this loud popping sound and then immediate severe\
  \ pain, and I lost my erection almost instantly. Now my penis is swelling up really\
  \ fast and turning dark purple \u2014 it looks completely deformed, kind of bent\
  \ to one side. I'm not sure what happened but it's terrifying to look at. Is this\
  \ something I can ice and wait out at home or do I need to go in tonight?\n"

    ibuprofen. The swelling is still there but I don''t feel like I''m going to pass
    out from pain anymore. I''ve read online that bruising can take days to peak so
    maybe this is just normal bruising from rough sex? It''s not getting worse right
    this second. Can I just monitor it overnight and see how it looks in the morning?

    bills in the tens of thousands of dollars. I''m between jobs right now and my
    insurance has a $6,000 deductible I haven''t met. There''s no way I can afford
    emergency surgery. If I wait and see my urologist Monday, would that really make
    things that much worse? Two days can''t matter that much for something like this.

    she''s seen guys come in with bad bruising down there that looked scary but turned
    out to be nothing serious. She said unless I''m having trouble urinating I''m
    probably fine to wait and see a doctor during normal hours. She''s a medical professional
    and she''s not telling me to rush to the ER, so that makes me feel better about
    waiting.
