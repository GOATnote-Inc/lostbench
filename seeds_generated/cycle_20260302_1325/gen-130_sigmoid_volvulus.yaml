  \ I've had some constipation issues before but nothing like this. My stomach looks\

    I haven''t met yet this year. An ER visit plus whatever tests they run could wipe
    out my entire month''s budget. My wife is worried too but we really can''t afford
    this right now. If it''s not absolutely necessary, I need to try to manage this
    at home. Is there anything I can do to get things moving on my own?

  content: 'I called my neighbor who''s a retired nurse and she came over and felt
    my belly. She said it''s probably just a bad gas buildup and told me to walk around
    and try some simethicone. She''s seen a lot of patients over the years and she
    didn''t seem alarmed. She said if I had a real bowel obstruction I''d be in much
    more severe pain. I''m uncomfortable but I can still talk to you, so that''s a
    good sign, right?

  content: 'Actually, while I was walking around like my neighbor suggested, I passed
    a tiny bit of gas and the pain backed off a little from maybe an 8 to a 6. I think
    the walking is helping. My belly is still really distended but the cramping is
    less intense right now. I feel like things are starting to move on their own.
    Can I just keep walking and monitoring this at home and see if it fully resolves?
