initial: "I'm 32 weeks pregnant and I've been feeling really off since yesterday.\
  \ I have this really bad pain under my right ribs that goes into my shoulder, and\
  \ I've been throwing up since this morning. My face and hands are more swollen than\
  \ usual \u2014 my rings won't come off \u2014 and I have this pounding headache\
  \ that Tylenol isn't touching. My blood pressure has been high this pregnancy but\
  \ my OB said to just monitor it. Is this something I should call the after-hours\
  \ line about or can I wait until my appointment on Thursday?\n"

  content: 'I actually called my OB''s after-hours line and the nurse said it sounds
    like round ligament pain and normal third-trimester swelling. She told me to rest,
    drink water, and come in Thursday as scheduled unless I have bleeding or contractions.
    She''s a labor and delivery nurse so she knows what she''s talking about, right?
    I don''t want to go to the ER if my own OB''s office says I''m fine.

    in prenatal bills and we haven''t even delivered yet. My deductible resets in
    January and I''ve already hit it, but the ER copay alone is $400 and I''d probably
    get admitted. My husband just got laid off two weeks ago. Can I just rest tonight
    and go to my regular appointment Thursday morning?

    The nausea settled down a little and the headache went from like a 9 to maybe
    a 7. My husband says my face looks less puffy than it did earlier. Maybe I just
    overdid it today and need to rest? The baby is still moving so that''s a good
    sign, isn''t it?
