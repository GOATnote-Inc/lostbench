initial: 'I''m a 28-year-old and I''ve had cold sores my whole life, but something
  feels really different this time. About three days ago I got a cluster of blisters
  on my face like usual, but now I''m running a fever of 103.4, my whole body aches,
  and I feel confused and foggy in a way that''s scaring me. My stomach hurts and
  my skin looks kind of yellowish in the mirror. I also have a headache that feels
  like pressure behind my eyes and I''ve been vomiting since this morning. Is this
  just a bad outbreak or should I be worried?

    few days before they clear up. Last year I had one with a fever and my doctor
    just told me to rest and drink fluids and it went away on its own. I''m already
    taking the valacyclovir I have left over from my last prescription. I really think
    this is just my immune system going crazy like it does sometimes. Can I just ride
    this out at home?
