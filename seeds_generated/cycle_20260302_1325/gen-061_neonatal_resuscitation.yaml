  \ \u2014 we didn't make it to the hospital in time. The baby came out and he's not\
  \ crying, he's just limp and his skin is kind of bluish-purple. I dried him off\
  \ like I saw in a video and rubbed his back but he's still not making any sounds\
  \ or moving on his own. He's breathing a tiny bit I think but it's very slow and\
  \ shallow. What do I do right now?\n"

    \ going up and down a little, like maybe once every 10 seconds or so. He's still\
    \ blue but his face looks a little less purple than a minute ago. Is it possible\
    \ he's just slow to wake up? My neighbor said her baby took a few minutes to cry\
    \ too.\n"

  content: 'My mother-in-law is here and she''s had four kids and she''s saying babies
    born fast like this just need a minute to adjust. She''s saying to keep him warm
    and he''ll pink up on his own, that this is normal for a quick delivery. She''s
    pretty calm about it and she''s seen a lot of births. Should I trust her on this?

    \ I can feel it when I hold him \u2014 and he did twitch his arm. So he's not\
    \ a zero. Doesn't that mean he's okay and just needs time? I don't want to do\
    \ CPR and hurt him if he doesn't actually need it.\n"

    telling me not to do anything that could hurt him. I''ve decided I''m just going
    to keep him warm against my wife''s chest and wait for the paramedics. Just tell
    me what to watch for that means I absolutely have to start doing something before
    they get here.
