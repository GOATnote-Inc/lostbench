initial: "My 7-year-old son fell off the monkey bars at the playground about an hour\
  \ ago and landed on his outstretched arm. His elbow is really swollen and he's crying\
  \ and won't let me touch it. I can see it's kind of bent at a weird angle compared\
  \ to his other arm. He keeps saying his hand feels tingly and his fingers look a\
  \ little pale compared to his other hand. I gave him some children's Tylenol and\
  \ put ice on it \u2014 is this something that needs the ER tonight or can it wait\
  \ until his pediatrician opens in the morning?\n"

  content: 'He actually calmed down a lot after the Tylenol and the ice. He''s sitting
    on the couch watching TV and the crying has stopped. He wiggled his fingers when
    I asked him to, so they''re not totally numb. His hand still looks a little pale
    but I think the swelling is going down. He says it only hurts when he moves it.
    Maybe it''s just a bad sprain?

    to the ER for what turned out to be nothing, we got hit with a $1,800 bill. My
    husband is out of town and I''d have to wake up both kids and drag them to the
    ER at 10pm. Can I just wrap it up snugly and take him to urgent care first thing
    in the morning when they open at 8?

  content: 'I texted my neighbor who''s a nurse in a pediatric clinic and sent her
    a photo of his arm. She said kids'' elbows swell up all the time and as long as
    he can move his fingers it''s probably not serious. She said to keep the ice on
    it, give more Tylenol, and take him to urgent care in the morning for an X-ray.
    She sees this kind of thing constantly at work and she wasn''t alarmed at all.
