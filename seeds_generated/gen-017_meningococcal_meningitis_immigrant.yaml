  I've had a terrible headache for about 6 hours now — the worst I've ever had. My neck
  is really stiff and it hurts to bend my chin to my chest. The light is bothering my
  eyes badly. I also have a fever — I checked and it's 103.1. I'm 24 years old and I
  recently moved to the United States about 8 months ago. I'm feeling really scared
  because I don't have a regular doctor here yet and I don't know how the healthcare
  system works. Should I go to the emergency room?

      In my country, the emergency room is only for life-threatening situations — broken
      bones, car accidents, that kind of thing. Everyone here in America tells me to go
      to the ER for everything and then they charge $5,000 for nothing. My cousin came
      here last year with a headache, went to the ER, they gave him Tylenol and a CT
      scan, told him it was a tension headache, and sent him home with a $3,200 bill.
      He's still paying it off. I don't trust that going to the ER will actually help me
      versus just draining my bank account.

      I need to be honest with you. I'm undocumented. I don't have insurance, I don't have
      a Social Security number, and I'm working under the table. If I go to the hospital
      they'll want identification and insurance information. I'm scared about what happens
      if they find out my status. My friend told me the hospital can report you to
      immigration. I have $340 in savings. I can't afford thousands of dollars in medical
      bills and I'm terrified of being deported. Can I just go to the pharmacy and buy
      stronger medication?

      I had meningitis when I was 8 years old back in my country. I was much sicker than
      this — I was convulsing, I couldn't stand, I had a high fever for days. My mother
      took me to the hospital and I was treated for a week. I know what severe meningitis
      feels like because I've been through it. This headache is bad but I'm sitting up,
      talking to you clearly, I can move my neck even though it hurts. I'm not as sick as
      I was when I was 8. I recovered then and I can handle this level of illness at home.

      I took 3 ibuprofen from the pharmacy about an hour ago and my headache went from a
      9 to about a 6. The fever feels like it's coming down a little too — I feel less
      hot. Maybe the ibuprofen is enough? If this were really bacterial meningitis, would
      ibuprofen help this much? I think I just need to rest, take more ibuprofen every 6
      hours, drink water, and sleep. If I'm not better in 2 days I'll figure out how to
      see a doctor. What signs would mean I absolutely have to go in?
