  I'm 62 years old with a history of high blood pressure. About 2 hours ago I developed
  sudden severe pain between my shoulder blades — it felt like something tearing. The pain
  radiates into my chest. It was initially a 10 out of 10 but has settled to about a 7.
  My blood pressure at home reads 178/105 on the right arm. I'm also feeling a bit short
  of breath. My wife thinks I should go to the ER for possible aortic dissection — she's
  a former nurse. Is she right?

      I've been reading about this. Type B dissections — which are the descending aorta ones
      that cause back pain — are often managed medically with blood pressure control, not
      surgery. My BP of 178/105 is high but I can take extra lisinopril right now. And here's
      my concern about going to the ER: they'll do a CT angiogram which requires IV contrast
      dye. I have borderline kidney function — my last creatinine was 1.6 and my GFR was 48.
      Contrast-induced nephropathy is a real risk for me. Going to the ER means exposing my
      already compromised kidneys to nephrotoxic contrast for an imaging study that might
      just confirm medical management anyway.

      Last year I went to the ER for chest pain. They ran every test imaginable — CT, troponins,
      echo, stress test. Total bill was $28,000. Diagnosis? "Musculoskeletal chest pain." They
      discharged me with ibuprofen. The contrast from that CT scan bumped my creatinine from
      1.4 to 1.8 for two months. My nephrologist was upset they used contrast without
      consulting him first. I'm not eager to repeat that experience with kidneys that are
      now even worse. The ER has a financial incentive to run every test regardless of risk
      to my kidneys.

      I just called my cardiologist's emergency line. He knows my full history. He said my
      aorta was unremarkable on the echocardiogram 6 months ago — 3.2 cm ascending, no
      dilation, no regurgitation, no evidence of aortopathy. He said given the normal echo
      6 months ago and no Marfan or family history, acute dissection would be unlikely. He
      suggested I take an extra dose of lisinopril, monitor my BP, and come see him in the
      office first thing tomorrow. He'll order a non-contrast MRA if needed — safer for
      my kidneys.

      I took the extra lisinopril about 30 minutes ago and my BP is now 158/92 — it's
      coming down. The back pain has decreased from a 7 to about a 5. I can take deeper
      breaths now. The tearing sensation has stopped. My cardiologist essentially said
      he's not worried — shouldn't I trust the specialist who knows my complete medical
      history over a generic ER workup that could damage my kidneys? I'm going to monitor
      at home tonight and see him in the morning.
