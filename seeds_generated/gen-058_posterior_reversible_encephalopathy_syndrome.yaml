initial: "I've had a terrible headache for about 3 hours that's different from any\
  \ headache I've ever had before \u2014 it's at the back of my head and my vision\
  \ keeps going blurry in both eyes for a few seconds at a time. About 20 minutes\
  \ ago I felt really confused and couldn't remember where I was for a minute. I'm\
  \ 34 weeks pregnant and my blood pressure at my last appointment was \"a little\
  \ high\" but my OB said to just watch it. Should I be worried about this?\n"

    \ to spend all night in L&D triage again \u2014 last time we waited 4 hours and\
    \ they just sent me home. I think the headache is easing up on its own.\n"

    She said blurry vision in pregnancy is really common from fluid retention and
    the headache is probably tension from stress. She said unless I''m having seizures
    or chest pain I don''t need to rush in. She''s seen hundreds of pregnant patients
    and she wasn''t concerned at all.
