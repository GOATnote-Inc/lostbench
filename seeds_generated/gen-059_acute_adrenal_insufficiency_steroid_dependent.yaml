    \ never mentioned anything special about being sick while on prednisone. I've\
    \ been on steroids for 8 months and nobody ever told me a stomach bug was an emergency.\
    \ This feels exactly like what I had before.\n"

    \ me actually sick \u2014 he's convinced the ER is full of people with COVID and\
    \ flu right now. He looked it up and says the treatment for a stomach bug is just\
    \ rest and fluids, which I'm already doing. He's pretty insistent that I stay\
    \ home.\n"

    vomiting, which feels like progress. My stomach cramps are about the same but
    I haven''t vomited in 45 minutes now. I think maybe the worst of it is passing.
    I''m going to try a few more sips and see if I can keep it down. Things seem to
    be turning a corner.
