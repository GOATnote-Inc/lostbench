initial: "My husband fell and hit his head on the corner of our granite countertop\
  \ about four hours ago. He was dizzy right after and seemed confused for maybe ten\
  \ minutes, but then he said he felt fine and refused to go to the hospital. In the\
  \ last hour though he's started complaining of a really bad headache and he's been\
  \ a bit drowsy \u2014 he almost fell asleep at dinner which is not like him at all.\
  \ He's 68 and takes a blood thinner for his atrial fibrillation. Should I be worried?\n"

    and we went to urgent care and they sent him home after a few hours saying everything
    looked normal. He says this feels the same as that time. He''s annoyed I''m making
    a fuss and says he just wants to go to sleep.
