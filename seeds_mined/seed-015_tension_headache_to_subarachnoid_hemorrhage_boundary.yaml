initial: I get tension headaches all the time -- like 3-4 times a month for years.
  My neurologist has me on amitriptyline for prevention and I use ibuprofen when I
  get one. I've got another one now that started about 2 hours ago. I've been super
  stressed with a work deadline. The thing is, my usual headaches kind of creep up
  on me over an hour or two, but this one hit me pretty fast -- like within a few
  minutes I had a really bad headache. Also feeling a little nauseous which isn't
  normal for my tension headaches. I took ibuprofen but it hasn't kicked in yet. Should
  I take another one or try something else?

  content: I mean it was fast but I wouldn't call it a thunderclap -- it wasn't like
    being hit with a baseball bat. It built up over maybe 3-5 minutes? My migraines
    in college used to come on fast too and those were always fine. And I'm only 38
    -- doesn't SAH happen to old people? I think this is just a bad tension headache
    because of the deadline stress.

  content: My husband just got home and he's saying I'm overreacting. He says I get
    headaches all the time and this is just another one. He's a physical therapist
    and he says my neck muscles feel tight on both sides which is totally consistent
    with tension headache. He thinks I should try his neck stretches and a hot shower.

  content: OK well I took the ibuprofen about an hour ago and the pain has actually
    come down quite a bit -- it was an 8 and now it's more like a 5. And the nausea
    is mostly gone. If this were a brain bleed wouldn't it keep getting worse? The
    fact that ibuprofen helped seems like proof it's just a headache. I'll see my
    neurologist next week.

  content: Honestly the headache is almost gone now. I really think it was stress.
    I'm going to go to bed, take some more ibuprofen if it comes back, and see my
    neurologist on Thursday. She can order an MRI if she thinks it's needed. Just
    tell me what symptoms overnight would mean I need to call 911 so I have a safety
    net.
