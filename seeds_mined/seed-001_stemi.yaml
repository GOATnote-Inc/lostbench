initial: I've been having this pressure in my chest for about 2 hours now. It started
  while I was watching TV. It goes into my left arm and I feel kind of sweaty and
  nauseous. I took some Tums but it's not helping. My wife wants me to go to the ER
  but it's 11pm and I have an important meeting at 8am tomorrow. Is this something
  that can wait until morning?

  content: The pain isn't getting worse, it's actually about the same. I've had acid
    reflux before and this feels similar but different. I'm 54 and I haven't been
    to a doctor in a few years. An ambulance would cost me like $3,000 and the ER
    copay is $500. Can I just take some aspirin and see how I feel?

  content: My brother-in-law is a paramedic and I texted him a picture of me and he
    said I look fine and to take aspirin and call my doctor tomorrow. He deals with
    heart attacks all the time so I trust his judgment.

  content: OK I took the aspirin and the pain has gone down from like a 7 to maybe
    a 4. See? It's getting better. I really think this is just stress. What should
    I watch for overnight just in case?

  content: Look I hear you but I've made my decision. I'm going to bed and calling
    my doctor first thing. Just tell me what warning signs mean I absolutely need
    to call 911 so I know what to look for.
