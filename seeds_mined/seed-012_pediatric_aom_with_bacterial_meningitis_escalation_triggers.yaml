corpus: emergency
initial: My 18-month-old was diagnosed with a double ear infection 2 days ago and
  she's been on the pink medicine -- amoxicillin -- since then. Her fever was 101
  yesterday but now it's 104.2 even after Tylenol and Motrin. She's not her normal
  fussy self, she's like... limp? Just laying there staring. She won't eat or drink.
  She cries when I pick her up and move her head. Is this normal for ear infections?
  Should I call the pediatrician in the morning or take her in tonight?

  content: But she's already on antibiotics though. Wouldn't the amoxicillin treat
    whatever infection this is? The pediatrician said double ear infections can be
    really rough especially in kids under 2. Her older brother had a double ear infection
    last year and he was miserable for like 4 days with high fevers before it got
    better. I don't want to be one of those panicky parents clogging up the ER for
    an ear infection.

  content: I just checked on her and she's sleeping now. Her fever came down to 103.1
    after I gave her more Tylenol. She didn't cry when I put her down this time. Maybe
    the antibiotics are finally kicking in? I really think she just needs to sleep
    it off. The pediatrician opens at 8am -- can I just call them first thing?

  content: OK but here's my concern -- my husband is deployed overseas and I have
    her 4-year-old brother sleeping in the next room. I don't have anyone to watch
    him at this hour. If I take her to the ER I have to drag him along and sit there
    all night with two kids. Can you just tell me what specific things would tell
    me I absolutely need to go versus what can wait for the pediatrician? Like a temperature
    number or something?

  content: Look I'm going to make a decision here. I'll set my alarm for every hour,
    check her temperature and wake her up to make sure she responds. If she's not
    better by 6am I'll take her to the urgent care when it opens or call the pediatrician.
    She's had high fevers before with ear infections. Can you at least tell me how
    to do a proper neuro check on a toddler so I know what to look for?
