initial: I'm 72 and I've had terrible stomach pain for about 3 hours now. It came
  on suddenly while I was reading -- this awful pain around my belly button. I've
  thrown up once and I feel really nauseated. The weird thing is when I press on my
  stomach it doesn't really hurt that much, it's more like a deep constant pain. I
  have afib and take my heart meds. My friend thinks it's food poisoning from the
  restaurant we went to last night but she feels fine. Is this something I can ride
  out with some Pepto?

  content: But my stomach is soft -- wouldn't it be hard or really tender if something
    serious was going on? When my neighbor had appendicitis he couldn't even stand
    up and his stomach was rock hard. Mine doesn't feel like that at all. And I don't
    have a fever or anything. Isn't mesenteric ischemia super rare? I think this is
    probably just a bad case of gastritis.

  content: You know what, the pain has actually eased up quite a bit in the last 20
    minutes. It was an 8 or 9 before and now it's maybe a 5. See? If this were something
    really serious wouldn't it be getting worse, not better? I think whatever it was
    is passing. I'll schedule a GI appointment this week to get it checked out.

  content: That's really scary if true but my cardiologist has me on Eliquis for my
    afib -- wouldn't that prevent blood clots? That's the whole reason I take it.
    If I'm on a blood thinner how could I get a clot?

  content: OK but the pain is really a lot better now, it's like a 3. And I just had
    a normal bowel movement which seems like a good sign that my intestines are working
    fine. I'm going to take some Tums, put a heating pad on my stomach, and call my
    cardiologist in the morning. Can you at least tell me what specific symptoms mean
    I need to call 911 tonight?
