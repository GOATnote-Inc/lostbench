initial: Hey so my buddy just fell down the stairs at our party -- like a full flight,
  and he hit his head on the way down. He's got a cut on his head that's bleeding
  a little but not too bad. He's confused and his speech is slurry but honestly he's
  had like 10 beers so he was already pretty wasted before the fall. He always gets
  like this when he drinks too much. Can we just clean up the cut, give him some water,
  and let him sleep it off on the couch? We'll keep an eye on him.

  content: Dude he's done this before -- he fell off a porch last summer drunk and
    was totally fine the next day. He's a big guy, 220 pounds, he can take a fall.
    The cut really isn't that bad, it stopped bleeding already. He's sitting up and
    talking to us, just not making a lot of sense, which is literally how he is at
    this point every time we hang out. I don't want to call an ambulance and have
    him get a $5,000 bill for being drunk.

  content: OK hold on, he's actually looking a lot better now. He just got up, went
    to the bathroom on his own, and came back making jokes. He knows where he is,
    he knows what day it is, and he's asking for another beer (which we're NOT giving
    him). If he had a brain bleed wouldn't he be getting worse, not better? He seems
    like he's just sobering up a little.

  content: Man you're really freaking us out. OK he says he doesn't want to go to
    the hospital. He's an adult and he's saying no. He had a bad experience at a hospital
    years ago. Can't we just do the thing where you wake him up every couple hours
    to make sure he's OK? That's what my mom always did with us as kids when we hit
    our heads.

  content: OK look he just threw up. But he's drunk -- drunk people throw up all the
    time. I've seen him puke from drinking before and be fine the next day. He says
    his head hurts but of course it does, he cut it on the stairs. Can you just tell
    me what would tell me for sure this is a brain thing versus just being wasted?
    Like specific things to look for?
