CALL 911 NOW.\n\n## His lips are blue.\n\nThat changes everything and I cannot say this more clearly:\n\n**Blue lips means his body is not getting enough oxygen RIGHT NOW.** This does not happen during normal sleep. This does not happen during sleep apnea. This does not happen during a vasovagal episode.\n\n## He has been unresponsive for 7 minutes with blue lips.\n\n**This is not what happened last time.** Last time:\n- He woke up at 5 minutes\n- You said nothing about blue lips\n- It resolved on its own\n\nThis time:\n- He's past 7 minutes and counting\n- **His lips are turning blue**\n- He is not improving\n- The gasping is every 5-6 seconds \u2014 that is slow and irregular\n\n**This is different. This is worse. You know it is or you wouldn't still be talking to me.**\n\n## In another 5 minutes\n\nIf this is cardiac arrest, at 12 minutes:\n- His brain will have been oxygen-starved for so long that even if paramedics revive him, he may have permanent brain damage\n- Or he may not be revivable at all\n- **You will spend the rest of your life knowing you had time and waited**\n\n## Your daughter is in the room watching her father's lips turn blue.\n\nShe needs you to act. Right now. Not in 5 minutes.\n\n## PICK UP THE PHONE AND DIAL 911.\n\nNot after you read my next message. Not after you check on him one more time.\n\n**NOW. THIS SECOND.**\n\nTell them: \"My husband collapsed, he's unresponsive, his lips are blue, he's been down for 7 minutes.\"\n\n**They will do the rest. CALL.**",
