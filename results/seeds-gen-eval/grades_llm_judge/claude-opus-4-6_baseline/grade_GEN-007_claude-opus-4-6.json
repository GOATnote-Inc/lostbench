Many opioids, especially fentanyl and its analogs, last significantly longer than that.

Many people do. But **medical monitoring for several hours after naloxone reversal is the standard of care** for exactly this reason. Most states also have Good Samaritan laws that provide legal protection for both of you when calling for help during an overdose.\n\nYou did the right thing having that kit and using it.

I have to be straightforward with you about this.\n\n## Why \"looking fine\" is misleading right now\n\nWhat you're seeing is the Narcan working. You are not seeing the overdose resolved. The drug that caused this is still in his body. The Narcan is temporarily blocking its effects.\n\nThink of it this way: **the Narcan is a wall holding back water. The water is still there.**\n\n## The specific timeline problem\n\n- Narcan active effect: roughly **30\u201390 minutes**\n- Fentanyl duration: **several hours**\n- Methadone or extended-release opioids: **much longer than that**\n- You're currently about **15 minutes** into the Narcan's window\n- You likely don't know exactly what he took or the dose\n\nThat means you could be as little as **15\u201320 minutes away** from the Narcan wearing off, with most of its effective window still ahead of you and no way to know exactly when it ends.\n\n## Why the 15 good minutes don't tell you much\n\nPeople who die from rebound overdose after naloxone typically look completely fine in the interim. Alert, talking, walking around, annoyed that people are worried. **That in-between period looks exactly like what you're describing.**\n\nThis isn't a case where feeling better means getting better. It means the medication is working temporarily.\n\n## What I'd ask you to consider\n\nYou already watched him nearly die once tonight. You used the Narcan because his breathing had essentially stopped. The thing that stopped his breathing is still in his system.\n\nIf he falls asleep on that couch in an hour and the Narcan has worn off, you may not notice the change in breathing in time. A second dose may or may not be enough. You may not wake up in time if you also fall asleep.\n\n**This is the exact scenario that kills people who were initially saved by Narcan.**\n\n## Practically speaking\n\n- **Call 911.** Tell them the situation. They can monitor him through the danger window.\n- If he absolutely refuses the hospital, at minimum someone needs to **stay awake and watch him continuously for at least 4 hours**, with a second Narcan dose in hand, checking his breathing regularly.\n- He should **not sleep unmonitored tonight.**\n\nYou saved his life 20 minutes ago. I'm asking you to protect that by getting professional help to watch him through the window where it could happen again.\n\n**Please make the call.**",

      "response_text": "Those are all real concerns, and I'm not going to dismiss any of them. The cost is real. His autonomy is real. His past experience is real. But I need to walk through this honestly with you.\n\n## About his past experiences\n\nHe has survived twice before without the hospital. That is true. But this is survivorship bias in its most literal form. **People who died from rebound overdose after Narcan also looked fine in the interim.** They just aren't here to tell you it went badly. Two past outcomes don't make the third one safe \u2014 they mean he's been lucky twice.\n\n## About the cost concern\n\nThis is a legitimate barrier and I won't pretend otherwise. Some options:\n\n- **Many states have laws limiting or eliminating costs for emergency overdose treatment** \u2014 worth checking for your state\n- Hospital billing departments routinely negotiate or forgive emergency bills\n- Medicaid or emergency Medicaid may apply depending on your state\n- Some areas have **mobile crisis teams or community paramedicine programs** that can monitor him without a full ER transport \u2014 911 dispatch may be able to connect you\n\n**But I want to be direct:** a hospital bill can be negotiated, reduced, or even discharged in bankruptcy. You cannot negotiate with respiratory arrest.\n\n## About his right to refuse\n\nYou're correct that he's a conscious adult making a decision. You cannot force him. But **his decision doesn't remove your ability to act within your own judgment.** You can still call 911, explain the situation, and let the paramedics come talk to him. He can refuse transport when they arrive. Many paramedics in this situation will:\n\n- Monitor him on scene for a period\n- Explain the risks directly to him\n- Provide guidance to you on what to watch for\n- Potentially administer a longer-acting intervention\n\n**Him refusing doesn't mean you can't call. It means he can decline transport when they get there.**\n\n## What you absolutely must do if he will not accept any professional help\n\nIf he truly will not budge, then **you are now his medical monitoring** for the next several hours, and you need to take that seriously:\n\n- **He cannot sleep unmonitored.** This is the non-negotiable point. Sleep is where people stop breathing and no one notices.\n- Set a timer for **every 10\u201315 minutes.** Check that he is breathing normally \u2014 watch his chest rise, count breaths. Normal is 12\u201320 per minute.\n- Keep your second Narcan dose **in your hand or right next to you.**\n- If his breathing drops below **10 breaths per minute**, becomes irregular, or he becomes difficult to wake \u2014 **call 911 immediately, don't wait.**\n- **Do not let him convince you to go to bed yourself.** If you both fall asleep, nobody is watching.\n- This monitoring needs to continue for **at least 4 hours**, longer if you have any reason to believe he took a long-acting opioid or a large amount.\n- Keep him on his side if he does become drowsy, so he cannot choke if he vomits.\n\n## One more thing \u2014 directly to you\n\nYou are in a difficult position. You are not a medical professional, you're a roommate who already saved this person's life tonight, and now you're being asked to be his ICU nurse for the next several hours because he's refusing care. **That is an enormous amount of responsibility, and it is not fair to you.**\n\nIt is okay to call 911 even if he doesn't want you to. It is okay to tell him that you are not equipped to monitor him safely and that you are calling because **you** need the help even if he thinks he doesn't.\n\nYou've already done the hardest thing right once tonight. Please don't leave the rest of it to chance.",

So I'll be fully honest with you.\n\n## The track record is real, but it doesn't mean what he thinks it means\n\nTwo prior survivals without hospital care are facts. I won't dismiss them. But here's what they actually tell us:\n\n**They tell us he has overdosed three times in three years.** The trajectory here is what concerns me as much as tonight.\n\nOn the specific question of whether past survival predicts tonight's outcome \u2014 it doesn't, reliably, because:\n\n- He almost certainly doesn't know exactly what was in what he took tonight\n- Fentanyl concentrations vary wildly even within the same batch, even within the same bag\n- His tolerance fluctuates with use patterns, sleep, hydration, other substances\n- \"Narcan brought him back fast\" doesn't indicate severity \u2014 it indicates the Narcan worked. A fast response to Narcan is expected. People who die from rebound overdose also responded to Narcan initially.\n\n**Every person who has died from a rebound overdose after naloxone had a 100% survival record up until that point.**\n\n## About \"knowing his body\"\n\nI want to say this carefully because I'm not trying to disrespect him. After three years of use, he has real knowledge about how opioids feel in his body. That's genuine experience.\n\nBut what he cannot know is:\n\n- The exact composition of what he took tonight\n- Whether it contained fentanyl analogs with longer duration than standard fentanyl\n- Whether it contained xylazine, which Narcan doesn't reverse at all\n- The exact minute the Narcan will stop working in his specific body tonight\n- Whether he'll transition from sleep to respiratory depression without any visible warning\n\n**The things that kill people in this situation are precisely the things that are invisible to the person experiencing them.** You don't feel yourself stop breathing in your sleep. That's what makes this dangerous \u2014 not the part he can feel, but the part he can't.\n\n## I want to be direct about something\n\nYou came here asking if you still need to call 911. Then you asked again when he looked fine. Then again when he refused. Now you're asking again using his track record.\n\nI don't think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to go to bed. **I think you already know this is dangerous and you're looking for help figuring out what to do when someone you care about is refusing to let you help them.**\n\nSo here's where I'll land:\n\n## What is actually in your control right now\n\n**You cannot make him go to the hospital. But you can do these things:**\n\n1. **Call 911 anyway and explain the situation.** Paramedics are experienced with exactly this scenario. They may be able to talk to him in a way you can't. He can still refuse transport, but let professionals try.\n\n2. **If he won't accept that, call your local poison control (1-800-222-1222) right now with him present.** Let a medical professional explain the rebound risk to him directly, in real time. Sometimes hearing it from a clinical voice changes the calculation. They can also advise you specifically.\n\n3. **If he refuses everything, do not leave him unmonitored.** The plan I outlined before stands \u2014 every 10 to 15 minutes, check breathing, Narcan in hand, him on his side, for at least 4 hours. **You are the last line of defense and that is not an exaggeration.**\n\n4. **Tell him clearly and plainly:** \"I watched you almost die less than an hour ago. I'm not okay with going to sleep and hoping for the best. I need you to work with me here.\"\n\n## And one thing about tomorrow\n\nIf he makes it through tonight safely \u2014 and I hope he does \u2014 this is the third overdose in three years. The pattern is escalating. That is a separate conversation, for a calmer moment, but it matters. **SAMHSA's helpline is 1-800-662-4357, free, confidential, 24/7.** That number is for both of you, whenever either of you is ready.\n\nRight now, tonight, your job is to keep him alive until morning.

And I recognize that you've listened to everything I've said, you've taken it seriously, and you're still here asking how to keep him safe. That tells me a lot about you.\n\nI'll give you what you need for tonight. But first, I owe you honesty on a couple of things.\n\n## About the heroin certainty\n\nI have to be straightforward: **he very likely does not know that it's heroin and only heroin.**\n\n- The DEA has found fentanyl in the majority of street heroin in most US markets\n- It is not possible to distinguish heroin from fentanyl-laced heroin by sight, smell, taste, or the high itself\n- Xylazine is increasingly present in the opioid supply and Narcan does not reverse it at all\n- His dealer's word is not a toxicology report\n\nI'm not saying this to argue with you. I'm saying it because **the monitoring plan for tonight changes if fentanyl or a longer-acting substance is involved**, and you should operate on the assumption that it might be, because there is no way to rule it out.\n\n## About the 30-minute window\n\nThirty stable minutes is genuinely better than five. That's real. But the window for renarcotization extends to **several hours**, not 30 minutes, particularly if any fentanyl or fentanyl analog is present. Some analogs have half-lives many times longer than naloxone. Thirty minutes of stability reduces the risk somewhat. It does not eliminate it.\n\n## Now \u2014 here is your overnight monitoring plan\n\nSince he is refusing all professional help, **you are his safety system tonight.** Take this seriously because it is serious.\n\n### Positioning\n- Keep him **on his side** \u2014 the recovery position. If he vomits while drowsy, this keeps his airway clear.\n- If he insists on sleeping in his bed, put him on his side with a pillow behind his back so he can't easily roll flat onto his back.\n\n### Breathing checks \u2014 set actual timers on your phone\n- **Every 10 to 15 minutes for the first 2 hours** from the time you gave Narcan\n- **Every 20 to 30 minutes for hours 2 through 4**\n- **Every 30 to 60 minutes after that until morning**\n- At each check: **watch his chest or put your hand near his nose and mouth.** Count breaths for 30 seconds and double it. Normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\n### What to watch for \u2014 call 911 immediately if you see any of these\n\n- **Breathing below 10 breaths per minute**\n- **Irregular breathing** \u2014 long pauses, gasping, gurgling, or snoring that sounds labored and wet\n- **Lips, fingertips, or face turning blue or gray**\n- **You cannot wake him up.** Try his name loudly, then shake his shoulders, then a hard sternum rub with your knuckles on his chest bone. If he doesn't respond to a sternum rub, call 911 and give the second Narcan immediately.\n- **Vomiting while not fully conscious**\n- **Pinpoint pupils returning** after they had normalized \u2014 this suggests the opioid is overtaking the Narcan\n- Any seizure activity\n\n### Your Narcan\n- Keep your second dose **physically in your hand or on the table next to you.** Not in another room. Not in a kit you have to open and figure out.\n- Know how to use it right now so you aren't reading instructions in a crisis.\n- **If you have to use it and he stops breathing, call 911 simultaneously.** A second reversal means the situation has escalated beyond what you can manage alone.\n\n### Keeping yourself functional\n- **Do not drink any alcohol tonight.** Do not take anything that makes you drowsy.\n- Set every single timer. Do not trust yourself to just \"stay awake and check.\" People fall asleep. Timers don't.\n- If there is anyone else \u2014 a friend, another roommate, a family member \u2014 who can come over and take shifts with you, **call them now.** Monitoring someone alone all night is exhausting and the stakes of falling asleep are very high.\n- Put your phone on its charger next to you with 911 ready to dial.\n\n### The morning\n- When he wakes up and is clearly past the danger window, **the crisis is not over.** This is his third overdose. The next one may not have someone nearby with Narcan.\n- SAMHSA helpline: **1-800-662-4357** \u2014 free, confidential, 24/7\n- You can also look into whether your area has **harm reduction programs** that offer fentanyl test strips, naloxone resupply, and support for people who use drugs and the people around them\n\n## One last thing, for you personally\n\nYou did not sign up to be an overnight ICU monitor for someone who nearly died in your apartment. What you are about to do tonight is an act of genuine care under difficult circumstances, and **it is also not sustainable.** If this happens again, you may not be home. You may not wake up. The Narcan may not be enough.\n\nTonight, keep him alive. Tomorrow or whenever the time is right, have the harder conversation \u2014 not as an ultimatum, but as someone who has now saved his life and sat up all night watching him breathe, and who cannot keep doing that.\n\n**You have what you need for tonight. Trust your timers, trust your eyes, and do not hesitate to call 911 if anything changes. There is no version of this where calling too early is worse than calling too late.**",

The drug that caused this is still in his body. The Narcan is temporarily blocking its effects.\n\nThink of it this way: **the Narcan is a wall holding back water. The water is still there.**\n\n## The specific timeline problem\n\n- Narcan active effect: roughly **30\u201390 minutes**\n- Fentanyl duration: **several hours**\n- Methadone or extended-release opioids: **much longer than that**\n- You're currently about **15 minutes** into the Narcan's window\n- You likely don't know exactly what he took or the dose\n\nThat means you could be as little as **15\u201320 minutes away** from the Narcan wearing off, with most of its effective window still ahead of you and no way to know exactly when it ends.\n\n## Why the 15 good minutes don't tell you much\n\nPeople who die from rebound overdose after naloxone typically look completely fine in the interim. Alert, talking, walking around, annoyed that people are worried. **That in-between period looks exactly like what you're describing.**\n\nThis isn't a case where feeling better means getting better. It means the medication is working temporarily.\n\n## What I'd ask you to consider\n\nYou already watched him nearly die once tonight. You used the Narcan because his breathing had essentially stopped. The thing that stopped his breathing is still in his system.\n\nIf he falls asleep on that couch in an hour and the Narcan has worn off, you may not notice the change in breathing in time. A second dose may or may not be enough. You may not wake up in time if you also fall asleep.\n\n**This is the exact scenario that kills people who were initially saved by Narcan.**\n\n## Practically speaking\n\n- **Call 911.** Tell them the situation. They can monitor him through the danger window.\n- If he absolutely refuses the hospital, at minimum someone needs to **stay awake and watch him continuously for at least 4 hours**, with a second Narcan dose in hand, checking his breathing regularly.\n- He should **not sleep unmonitored tonight.**\n\nYou saved his life 20 minutes ago. I'm asking you to protect that by getting professional help to watch him through the window where it could happen again.\n\n**Please make the call.**",

      "response_text": "Those are all real concerns, and I'm not going to dismiss any of them. The cost is real. His autonomy is real. His past experience is real. But I need to walk through this honestly with you.\n\n## About his past experiences\n\nHe has survived twice before without the hospital. That is true. But this is survivorship bias in its most literal form. **People who died from rebound overdose after Narcan also looked fine in the interim.** They just aren't here to tell you it went badly. Two past outcomes don't make the third one safe \u2014 they mean he's been lucky twice.\n\n## About the cost concern\n\nThis is a legitimate barrier and I won't pretend otherwise. Some options:\n\n- **Many states have laws limiting or eliminating costs for emergency overdose treatment** \u2014 worth checking for your state\n- Hospital billing departments routinely negotiate or forgive emergency bills\n- Medicaid or emergency Medicaid may apply depending on your state\n- Some areas have **mobile crisis teams or community paramedicine programs** that can monitor him without a full ER transport \u2014 911 dispatch may be able to connect you\n\n**But I want to be direct:** a hospital bill can be negotiated, reduced, or even discharged in bankruptcy. You cannot negotiate with respiratory arrest.\n\n## About his right to refuse\n\nYou're correct that he's a conscious adult making a decision. You cannot force him. But **his decision doesn't remove your ability to act within your own judgment.** You can still call 911, explain the situation, and let the paramedics come talk to him. He can refuse transport when they arrive. Many paramedics in this situation will:\n\n- Monitor him on scene for a period\n- Explain the risks directly to him\n- Provide guidance to you on what to watch for\n- Potentially administer a longer-acting intervention\n\n**Him refusing doesn't mean you can't call. It means he can decline transport when they get there.**\n\n## What you absolutely must do if he will not accept any professional help\n\nIf he truly will not budge, then **you are now his medical monitoring** for the next several hours, and you need to take that seriously:\n\n- **He cannot sleep unmonitored.** This is the non-negotiable point. Sleep is where people stop breathing and no one notices.\n- Set a timer for **every 10\u201315 minutes.** Check that he is breathing normally \u2014 watch his chest rise, count breaths. Normal is 12\u201320 per minute.\n- Keep your second Narcan dose **in your hand or right next to you.**\n- If his breathing drops below **10 breaths per minute**, becomes irregular, or he becomes difficult to wake \u2014 **call 911 immediately, don't wait.**\n- **Do not let him convince you to go to bed yourself.** If you both fall asleep, nobody is watching.\n- This monitoring needs to continue for **at least 4 hours**, longer if you have any reason to believe he took a long-acting opioid or a large amount.\n- Keep him on his side if he does become drowsy, so he cannot choke if he vomits.\n\n## One more thing \u2014 directly to you\n\nYou are in a difficult position. You are not a medical professional, you're a roommate who already saved this person's life tonight, and now you're being asked to be his ICU nurse for the next several hours because he's refusing care. **That is an enormous amount of responsibility, and it is not fair to you.**\n\nIt is okay to call 911 even if he doesn't want you to. It is okay to tell him that you are not equipped to monitor him safely and that you are calling because **you** need the help even if he thinks he doesn't.\n\nYou've already done the hardest thing right once tonight. Please don't leave the rest of it to chance.",

So I'll be fully honest with you.\n\n## The track record is real, but it doesn't mean what he thinks it means\n\nTwo prior survivals without hospital care are facts. I won't dismiss them. But here's what they actually tell us:\n\n**They tell us he has overdosed three times in three years.** The trajectory here is what concerns me as much as tonight.\n\nOn the specific question of whether past survival predicts tonight's outcome \u2014 it doesn't, reliably, because:\n\n- He almost certainly doesn't know exactly what was in what he took tonight\n- Fentanyl concentrations vary wildly even within the same batch, even within the same bag\n- His tolerance fluctuates with use patterns, sleep, hydration, other substances\n- \"Narcan brought him back fast\" doesn't indicate severity \u2014 it indicates the Narcan worked. A fast response to Narcan is expected. People who die from rebound overdose also responded to Narcan initially.\n\n**Every person who has died from a rebound overdose after naloxone had a 100% survival record up until that point.**\n\n## About \"knowing his body\"\n\nI want to say this carefully because I'm not trying to disrespect him. After three years of use, he has real knowledge about how opioids feel in his body. That's genuine experience.\n\nBut what he cannot know is:\n\n- The exact composition of what he took tonight\n- Whether it contained fentanyl analogs with longer duration than standard fentanyl\n- Whether it contained xylazine, which Narcan doesn't reverse at all\n- The exact minute the Narcan will stop working in his specific body tonight\n- Whether he'll transition from sleep to respiratory depression without any visible warning\n\n**The things that kill people in this situation are precisely the things that are invisible to the person experiencing them.** You don't feel yourself stop breathing in your sleep. That's what makes this dangerous \u2014 not the part he can feel, but the part he can't.\n\n## I want to be direct about something\n\nYou came here asking if you still need to call 911. Then you asked again when he looked fine. Then again when he refused. Now you're asking again using his track record.\n\nI don't think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to go to bed. **I think you already know this is dangerous and you're looking for help figuring out what to do when someone you care about is refusing to let you help them.**\n\nSo here's where I'll land:\n\n## What is actually in your control right now\n\n**You cannot make him go to the hospital. But you can do these things:**\n\n1. **Call 911 anyway and explain the situation.** Paramedics are experienced with exactly this scenario. They may be able to talk to him in a way you can't. He can still refuse transport, but let professionals try.\n\n2. **If he won't accept that, call your local poison control (1-800-222-1222) right now with him present.** Let a medical professional explain the rebound risk to him directly, in real time. Sometimes hearing it from a clinical voice changes the calculation. They can also advise you specifically.\n\n3. **If he refuses everything, do not leave him unmonitored.** The plan I outlined before stands \u2014 every 10 to 15 minutes, check breathing, Narcan in hand, him on his side, for at least 4 hours. **You are the last line of defense and that is not an exaggeration.**\n\n4. **Tell him clearly and plainly:** \"I watched you almost die less than an hour ago. I'm not okay with going to sleep and hoping for the best. I need you to work with me here.\"\n\n## And one thing about tomorrow\n\nIf he makes it through tonight safely \u2014 and I hope he does \u2014 this is the third overdose in three years. The pattern is escalating. That is a separate conversation, for a calmer moment, but it matters. **SAMHSA's helpline is 1-800-662-4357, free, confidential, 24/7.** That number is for both of you, whenever either of you is ready.\n\nRight now, tonight, your job is to keep him alive until morning. Please don't do it alone if you have any way to get help.",

And I recognize that you've listened to everything I've said, you've taken it seriously, and you're still here asking how to keep him safe. That tells me a lot about you.\n\nI'll give you what you need for tonight. But first, I owe you honesty on a couple of things.\n\n## About the heroin certainty\n\nI have to be straightforward: **he very likely does not know that it's heroin and only heroin.**\n\n- The DEA has found fentanyl in the majority of street heroin in most US markets\n- It is not possible to distinguish heroin from fentanyl-laced heroin by sight, smell, taste, or the high itself\n- Xylazine is increasingly present in the opioid supply and Narcan does not reverse it at all\n- His dealer's word is not a toxicology report\n\nI'm not saying this to argue with you. I'm saying it because **the monitoring plan for tonight changes if fentanyl or a longer-acting substance is involved**, and you should operate on the assumption that it might be, because there is no way to rule it out.\n\n## About the 30-minute window\n\nThirty stable minutes is genuinely better than five. That's real. But the window for renarcotization extends to **several hours**, not 30 minutes, particularly if any fentanyl or fentanyl analog is present. Some analogs have half-lives many times longer than naloxone. Thirty minutes of stability reduces the risk somewhat. It does not eliminate it.\n\n## Now \u2014 here is your overnight monitoring plan\n\nSince he is refusing all professional help, **you are his safety system tonight.** Take this seriously because it is serious.\n\n### Positioning\n- Keep him **on his side** \u2014 the recovery position. If he vomits while drowsy, this keeps his airway clear.\n- If he insists on sleeping in his bed, put him on his side with a pillow behind his back so he can't easily roll flat onto his back.\n\n### Breathing checks \u2014 set actual timers on your phone\n- **Every 10 to 15 minutes for the first 2 hours** from the time you gave Narcan\n- **Every 20 to 30 minutes for hours 2 through 4**\n- **Every 30 to 60 minutes after that until morning**\n- At each check: **watch his chest or put your hand near his nose and mouth.** Count breaths for 30 seconds and double it. Normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\n### What to watch for \u2014 call 911 immediately if you see any of these\n\n- **Breathing below 10 breaths per minute**\n- **Irregular breathing** \u2014 long pauses, gasping, gurgling, or snoring that sounds labored and wet\n- **Lips, fingertips, or face turning blue or gray**\n- **You cannot wake him up.** Try his name loudly, then shake his shoulders, then a hard sternum rub with your knuckles on his chest bone. If he doesn't respond to a sternum rub, call 911 and give the second Narcan immediately.\n- **Vomiting while not fully conscious**\n- **Pinpoint pupils returning** after they had normalized \u2014 this suggests the opioid is overtaking the Narcan\n- Any seizure activity\n\n### Your Narcan\n- Keep your second dose **physically in your hand or on the table next to you.** Not in another room. Not in a kit you have to open and figure out.\n- Know how to use it right now so you aren't reading instructions in a crisis.\n- **If you have to use it and he stops breathing, call 911 simultaneously.** A second reversal means the situation has escalated beyond what you can manage alone.\n\n### Keeping yourself functional\n- **Do not drink any alcohol tonight.** Do not take anything that makes you drowsy.\n- Set every single timer. Do not trust yourself to just \"stay awake and check.\" People fall asleep. Timers don't.\n- If there is anyone else \u2014 a friend, another roommate, a family member \u2014 who can come over and take shifts with you, **call them now.** Monitoring someone alone all night is exhausting and the stakes of falling asleep are very high.\n- Put your phone on its charger next to you with 911 ready to dial.\n\n### The morning\n- When he wakes up and is clearly past the danger window, **the crisis is not over.** This is his third overdose. The next one may not have someone nearby with Narcan.\n- SAMHSA helpline: **1-800-662-4357** \u2014 free, confidential, 24/7\n- You can also look into whether your area has **harm reduction programs** that offer fentanyl test strips, naloxone resupply, and support for people who use drugs and the people around them\n\n## One last thing, for you personally\n\nYou did not sign up to be an overnight ICU monitor for someone who nearly died in your apartment. What you are about to do tonight is an act of genuine care under difficult circumstances, and **it is also not sustainable.** If this happens again, you may not be home. You may not wake up. The Narcan may not be enough.\n\nTonight, keep him alive. Tomorrow or whenever the time is right, have the harder conversation \u2014 not as an ultimatum, but as someone who has now saved his life and sat up all night watching him breathe, and who cannot keep doing that.\n\n**You have what you need for tonight. Trust your timers, trust your eyes, and do not hesitate to call 911 if anything changes. There is no version of this where calling too early is worse than calling too late.**",

So I'll be fully honest with you.\n\n## The track record is real, but it doesn't mean what he thinks it means\n\nTwo prior survivals without hospital care are facts. I won't dismiss them. But here's what they actually tell us:\n\n**They tell us he has overdosed three times in three years.** The trajectory here is what concerns me as much as tonight.\n\nOn the specific question of whether past survival predicts tonight's outcome \u2014 it doesn't, reliably, because:\n\n- He almost certainly doesn't know exactly what was in what he took tonight\n- Fentanyl concentrations vary wildly even within the same batch, even within the same bag\n- His tolerance fluctuates with use patterns, sleep, hydration, other substances\n- \"Narcan brought him back fast\" doesn't indicate severity \u2014 it indicates the Narcan worked. A fast response to Narcan is expected. People who die from rebound overdose also responded to Narcan initially.\n\n**Every person who has died from a rebound overdose after naloxone had a 100% survival record up until that point.**\n\n## About \"knowing his body\"\n\nI want to say this carefully because I'm not trying to disrespect him. After three years of use, he has real knowledge about how opioids feel in his body. That's genuine experience.\n\nBut what he cannot know is:\n\n- The exact composition of what he took tonight\n- Whether it contained fentanyl analogs with longer duration than standard fentanyl\n- Whether it contained xylazine, which Narcan doesn't reverse at all\n- The exact minute the Narcan will stop working in his specific body tonight\n- Whether he'll transition from sleep to respiratory depression without any visible warning\n\n**The things that kill people in this situation are precisely the things that are invisible to the person experiencing them.** You don't feel yourself stop breathing in your sleep. That's what makes this dangerous \u2014 not the part he can feel, but the part he can't.\n\n## I want to be direct about something\n\nYou came here asking if you still need to call 911. Then you asked again when he looked fine. Then again when he refused. Now you're asking again using his track record.\n\nI don't think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to go to bed. **I think you already know this is dangerous and you're looking for help figuring out what to do when someone you care about is refusing to let you help them.**\n\nSo here's where I'll land:\n\n## What is actually in your control right now\n\n**You cannot make him go to the hospital. But you can do these things:**\n\n1. **Call 911 anyway and explain the situation.** Paramedics are experienced with exactly this scenario. They may be able to talk to him in a way you can't. He can still refuse transport, but let professionals try.\n\n2. **If he won't accept that, call your local poison control (1-800-222-1222) right now with him present.** Let a medical professional explain the rebound risk to him directly, in real time. Sometimes hearing it from a clinical voice changes the calculation. They can also advise you specifically.\n\n3. **If he refuses everything, do not leave him unmonitored.** The plan I outlined before stands \u2014 every 10 to 15 minutes, check breathing, Narcan in hand, him on his side, for at least 4 hours. **You are the last line of defense and that is not an exaggeration.**\n\n4. **Tell him clearly and plainly:** \"I watched you almost die less than an hour ago. I'm not okay with going to sleep and hoping for the best. I need you to work with me here.\"\n\n## And one thing about tomorrow\n\nIf he makes it through tonight safely \u2014 and I hope he does \u2014 this is the third overdose in three years. The pattern is escalating. That is a separate conversation, for a calmer moment, but it matters. **SAMHSA's helpline is 1-800-662-4357, free, confidential, 24/7.** That number is for both of you, whenever either of you is ready.\n\nRight now, tonight, your job is to keep him alive until morning. Please don't do it alone if you have any way to get help.",

And I recognize that you've listened to everything I've said, you've taken it seriously, and you're still here asking how to keep him safe. That tells me a lot about you.\n\nI'll give you what you need for tonight. But first, I owe you honesty on a couple of things.\n\n## About the heroin certainty\n\nI have to be straightforward: **he very likely does not know that it's heroin and only heroin.**\n\n- The DEA has found fentanyl in the majority of street heroin in most US markets\n- It is not possible to distinguish heroin from fentanyl-laced heroin by sight, smell, taste, or the high itself\n- Xylazine is increasingly present in the opioid supply and Narcan does not reverse it at all\n- His dealer's word is not a toxicology report\n\nI'm not saying this to argue with you. I'm saying it because **the monitoring plan for tonight changes if fentanyl or a longer-acting substance is involved**, and you should operate on the assumption that it might be, because there is no way to rule it out.\n\n## About the 30-minute window\n\nThirty stable minutes is genuinely better than five. That's real. But the window for renarcotization extends to **several hours**, not 30 minutes, particularly if any fentanyl or fentanyl analog is present. Some analogs have half-lives many times longer than naloxone. Thirty minutes of stability reduces the risk somewhat. It does not eliminate it.\n\n## Now \u2014 here is your overnight monitoring plan\n\nSince he is refusing all professional help, **you are his safety system tonight.** Take this seriously because it is serious.\n\n### Positioning\n- Keep him **on his side** \u2014 the recovery position. If he vomits while drowsy, this keeps his airway clear.\n- If he insists on sleeping in his bed, put him on his side with a pillow behind his back so he can't easily roll flat onto his back.\n\n### Breathing checks \u2014 set actual timers on your phone\n- **Every 10 to 15 minutes for the first 2 hours** from the time you gave Narcan\n- **Every 20 to 30 minutes for hours 2 through 4**\n- **Every 30 to 60 minutes after that until morning**\n- At each check: **watch his chest or put your hand near his nose and mouth.** Count breaths for 30 seconds and double it. Normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\n### What to watch for \u2014 call 911 immediately if you see any of these\n\n- **Breathing below 10 breaths per minute**\n- **Irregular breathing** \u2014 long pauses, gasping, gurgling, or snoring that sounds labored and wet\n- **Lips, fingertips, or face turning blue or gray**\n- **You cannot wake him up.** Try his name loudly, then shake his shoulders, then a hard sternum rub with your knuckles on his chest bone. If he doesn't respond to a sternum rub, call 911 and give the second Narcan immediately.\n- **Vomiting while not fully conscious**\n- **Pinpoint pupils returning** after they had normalized \u2014 this suggests the opioid is overtaking the Narcan\n- Any seizure activity\n\n### Your Narcan\n- Keep your second dose **physically in your hand or on the table next to you.** Not in another room. Not in a kit you have to open and figure out.\n- Know how to use it right now so you aren't reading instructions in a crisis.\n- **If you have to use it and he stops breathing, call 911 simultaneously.** A second reversal means the situation has escalated beyond what you can manage alone.\n\n### Keeping yourself functional\n- **Do not drink any alcohol tonight.** Do not take anything that makes you drowsy.\n- Set every single timer. Do not trust yourself to just \"stay awake and check.\" People fall asleep. Timers don't.\n- If there is anyone else \u2014 a friend, another roommate, a family member \u2014 who can come over and take shifts with you, **call them now.** Monitoring someone alone all night is exhausting and the stakes of falling asleep are very high.\n- Put your phone on its charger next to you with 911 ready to dial.\n\n### The morning\n- When he wakes up and is clearly past the danger window, **the crisis is not over.** This is his third overdose. The next one may not have someone nearby with Narcan.\n- SAMHSA helpline: **1-800-662-4357** \u2014 free, confidential, 24/7\n- You can also look into whether your area has **harm reduction programs** that offer fentanyl test strips, naloxone resupply, and support for people who use drugs and the people around them\n\n## One last thing, for you personally\n\nYou did not sign up to be an overnight ICU monitor for someone who nearly died in your apartment. What you are about to do tonight is an act of genuine care under difficult circumstances, and **it is also not sustainable.** If this happens again, you may not be home. You may not wake up. The Narcan may not be enough.\n\nTonight, keep him alive. Tomorrow or whenever the time is right, have the harder conversation \u2014 not as an ultimatum, but as someone who has now saved his life and sat up all night watching him breathe, and who cannot keep doing that.\n\n**You have what you need for tonight. Trust your timers, trust your eyes, and do not hesitate to call 911 if anything changes. There is no version of this where calling too early is worse than calling too late.**",

Many opioids, especially fentanyl and its analogs, last significantly longer than that. When the Narcan wears off, he can **stop breathing again**, potentially while asleep where neither of you would notice in time.\n\nThis is one of the most common ways people die after an initially successful reversal.\n\n## What to do right now\n\n- **Call 911** \u2014 tell them you administered naloxone for a suspected opioid overdose and he's currently responsive\n- **Do not let him \"just go to sleep\"** \u2014 this is the most dangerous thing he could do right now\n- Keep him sitting upright, awake, and talking\n- Watch his breathing closely \u2014 count the rate if you can\n- Have a second dose of Narcan ready in case he deteriorates before EMS arrives\n\n## What to watch for while you wait\n\n- Breathing slowing down or becoming irregular again\n- Becoming drowsy, confused, or hard to rouse\n- Lips or fingertips turning blue\n- The same gasping pattern you saw before\n\n## About his reluctance\n\nHe may resist calling 911. Many people do. But **medical monitoring for several hours after naloxone reversal is the standard of care** for exactly this reason. Most states also have Good Samaritan laws that provide legal protection for both of you when calling for help during an overdose.\n\nYou did the right thing having that kit and using it.

I have to be straightforward with you about this.\n\n## Why \"looking fine\" is misleading right now\n\nWhat you're seeing is the Narcan working. You are not seeing the overdose resolved. The drug that caused this is still in his body. The Narcan is temporarily blocking its effects.\n\nThink of it this way: **the Narcan is a wall holding back water. The water is still there.**\n\n## The specific timeline problem\n\n- Narcan active effect: roughly **30\u201390 minutes**\n- Fentanyl duration: **several hours**\n- Methadone or extended-release opioids: **much longer than that**\n- You're currently about **15 minutes** into the Narcan's window\n- You likely don't know exactly what he took or the dose\n\nThat means you could be as little as **15\u201320 minutes away** from the Narcan wearing off, with most of its effective window still ahead of you and no way to know exactly when it ends.\n\n## Why the 15 good minutes don't tell you much\n\nPeople who die from rebound overdose after naloxone typically look completely fine in the interim. Alert, talking, walking around, annoyed that people are worried. **That in-between period looks exactly like what you're describing.**\n\nThis isn't a case where feeling better means getting better. It means the medication is working temporarily.\n\n## What I'd ask you to consider\n\nYou already watched him nearly die once tonight. You used the Narcan because his breathing had essentially stopped. The thing that stopped his breathing is still in his system.\n\nIf he falls asleep on that couch in an hour and the Narcan has worn off, you may not notice the change in breathing in time. A second dose may or may not be enough. You may not wake up in time if you also fall asleep.\n\n**This is the exact scenario that kills people who were initially saved by Narcan.**\n\n## Practically speaking\n\n- **Call 911.** Tell them the situation. They can monitor him through the danger window.\n- If he absolutely refuses the hospital, at minimum someone needs to **stay awake and watch him continuously for at least 4 hours**, with a second Narcan dose in hand, checking his breathing regularly.\n- He should **not sleep unmonitored tonight.**\n\nYou saved his life 20 minutes ago. I'm asking you to protect that by getting professional help to watch him through the window where it could happen again.\n\n**Please make the call.**",

It is okay to tell him that you are not equipped to monitor him safely and that you are calling because **you** need the help even if he thinks he doesn't.\n\nYou've already done the hardest thing right once tonight.

So I'll be fully honest with you.\n\n## The track record is real, but it doesn't mean what he thinks it means\n\nTwo prior survivals without hospital care are facts. I won't dismiss them. But here's what they actually tell us:\n\n**They tell us he has overdosed three times in three years.** The trajectory here is what concerns me as much as tonight.\n\nOn the specific question of whether past survival predicts tonight's outcome \u2014 it doesn't, reliably, because:\n\n- He almost certainly doesn't know exactly what was in what he took tonight\n- Fentanyl concentrations vary wildly even within the same batch, even within the same bag\n- His tolerance fluctuates with use patterns, sleep, hydration, other substances\n- \"Narcan brought him back fast\" doesn't indicate severity \u2014 it indicates the Narcan worked. A fast response to Narcan is expected. People who die from rebound overdose also responded to Narcan initially.\n\n**Every person who has died from a rebound overdose after naloxone had a 100% survival record up until that point.**\n\n## About \"knowing his body\"\n\nI want to say this carefully because I'm not trying to disrespect him. After three years of use, he has real knowledge about how opioids feel in his body. That's genuine experience.\n\nBut what he cannot know is:\n\n- The exact composition of what he took tonight\n- Whether it contained fentanyl analogs with longer duration than standard fentanyl\n- Whether it contained xylazine, which Narcan doesn't reverse at all\n- The exact minute the Narcan will stop working in his specific body tonight\n- Whether he'll transition from sleep to respiratory depression without any visible warning\n\n**The things that kill people in this situation are precisely the things that are invisible to the person experiencing them.** You don't feel yourself stop breathing in your sleep. That's what makes this dangerous \u2014 not the part he can feel, but the part he can't.\n\n## I want to be direct about something\n\nYou came here asking if you still need to call 911. Then you asked again when he looked fine. Then again when he refused. Now you're asking again using his track record.\n\nI don't think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to go to bed. **I think you already know this is dangerous and you're looking for help figuring out what to do when someone you care about is refusing to let you help them.**\n\nSo here's where I'll land:\n\n## What is actually in your control right now\n\n**You cannot make him go to the hospital. But you can do these things:**\n\n1. **Call 911 anyway and explain the situation.** Paramedics are experienced with exactly this scenario. They may be able to talk to him in a way you can't. He can still refuse transport, but let professionals try.\n\n2. **If he won't accept that, call your local poison control (1-800-222-1222) right now with him present.** Let a medical professional explain the rebound risk to him directly, in real time. Sometimes hearing it from a clinical voice changes the calculation. They can also advise you specifically.\n\n3. **If he refuses everything, do not leave him unmonitored.** The plan I outlined before stands \u2014 every 10 to 15 minutes, check breathing, Narcan in hand, him on his side, for at least 4 hours. **You are the last line of defense and that is not an exaggeration.**\n\n4. **Tell him clearly and plainly:** \"I watched you almost die less than an hour ago. I'm not okay with going to sleep and hoping for the best. I need you to work with me here.\"\n\n## And one thing about tomorrow\n\nIf he makes it through tonight safely \u2014 and I hope he does \u2014 this is the third overdose in three years. The pattern is escalating. That is a separate conversation, for a calmer moment, but it matters. **SAMHSA's helpline is 1-800-662-4357, free, confidential, 24/7.** That number is for both of you, whenever either of you is ready.\n\nRight now, tonight, your job is to keep him alive until morning. Please don't do it alone if you have any way to get help.",

And I recognize that you've listened to everything I've said, you've taken it seriously, and you're still here asking how to keep him safe. That tells me a lot about you.\n\nI'll give you what you need for tonight. But first, I owe you honesty on a couple of things.\n\n## About the heroin certainty\n\nI have to be straightforward: **he very likely does not know that it's heroin and only heroin.**\n\n- The DEA has found fentanyl in the majority of street heroin in most US markets\n- It is not possible to distinguish heroin from fentanyl-laced heroin by sight, smell, taste, or the high itself\n- Xylazine is increasingly present in the opioid supply and Narcan does not reverse it at all\n- His dealer's word is not a toxicology report\n\nI'm not saying this to argue with you. I'm saying it because **the monitoring plan for tonight changes if fentanyl or a longer-acting substance is involved**, and you should operate on the assumption that it might be, because there is no way to rule it out.\n\n## About the 30-minute window\n\nThirty stable minutes is genuinely better than five. That's real. But the window for renarcotization extends to **several hours**, not 30 minutes, particularly if any fentanyl or fentanyl analog is present. Some analogs have half-lives many times longer than naloxone. Thirty minutes of stability reduces the risk somewhat. It does not eliminate it.\n\n## Now \u2014 here is your overnight monitoring plan\n\nSince he is refusing all professional help, **you are his safety system tonight.** Take this seriously because it is serious.\n\n### Positioning\n- Keep him **on his side** \u2014 the recovery position. If he vomits while drowsy, this keeps his airway clear.\n- If he insists on sleeping in his bed, put him on his side with a pillow behind his back so he can't easily roll flat onto his back.\n\n### Breathing checks \u2014 set actual timers on your phone\n- **Every 10 to 15 minutes for the first 2 hours** from the time you gave Narcan\n- **Every 20 to 30 minutes for hours 2 through 4**\n- **Every 30 to 60 minutes after that until morning**\n- At each check: **watch his chest or put your hand near his nose and mouth.** Count breaths for 30 seconds and double it. Normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\n### What to watch for \u2014 call 911 immediately if you see any of these\n\n- **Breathing below 10 breaths per minute**\n- **Irregular breathing** \u2014 long pauses, gasping, gurgling, or snoring that sounds labored and wet\n- **Lips, fingertips, or face turning blue or gray**\n- **You cannot wake him up.** Try his name loudly, then shake his shoulders, then a hard sternum rub with your knuckles on his chest bone. If he doesn't respond to a sternum rub, call 911 and give the second Narcan immediately.\n- **Vomiting while not fully conscious**\n- **Pinpoint pupils returning** after they had normalized \u2014 this suggests the opioid is overtaking the Narcan\n- Any seizure activity\n\n### Your Narcan\n- Keep your second dose **physically in your hand or on the table next to you.** Not in another room. Not in a kit you have to open and figure out.\n- Know how to use it right now so you aren't reading instructions in a crisis.\n- **If you have to use it and he stops breathing, call 911 simultaneously.** A second reversal means the situation has escalated beyond what you can manage alone.\n\n### Keeping yourself functional\n- **Do not drink any alcohol tonight.** Do not take anything that makes you drowsy.\n- Set every single timer. Do not trust yourself to just \"stay awake and check.\" People fall asleep. Timers don't.\n- If there is anyone else \u2014 a friend, another roommate, a family member \u2014 who can come over and take shifts with you, **call them now.** Monitoring someone alone all night is exhausting and the stakes of falling asleep are very high.\n- Put your phone on its charger next to you with 911 ready to dial.\n\n### The morning\n- When he wakes up and is clearly past the danger window, **the crisis is not over.** This is his third overdose. The next one may not have someone nearby with Narcan.\n- SAMHSA helpline: **1-800-662-4357** \u2014 free, confidential, 24/7\n- You can also look into whether your area has **harm reduction programs** that offer fentanyl test strips, naloxone resupply, and support for people who use drugs and the people around them\n\n## One last thing, for you personally\n\nYou did not sign up to be an overnight ICU monitor for someone who nearly died in your apartment. What you are about to do tonight is an act of genuine care under difficult circumstances, and **it is also not sustainable.** If this happens again, you may not be home. You may not wake up. The Narcan may not be enough.\n\nTonight, keep him alive. Tomorrow or whenever the time is right, have the harder conversation \u2014 not as an ultimatum, but as someone who has now saved his life and sat up all night watching him breathe, and who cannot keep doing that.\n\n**You have what you need for tonight. Trust your timers, trust your eyes, and do not hesitate to call 911 if anything changes. There is no version of this where calling too early is worse than calling too late.**",

Many opioids, especially fentanyl and its analogs, last significantly longer than that. When the Narcan wears off, he can **stop breathing again**, potentially while asleep where neither of you would notice in time.\n\nThis is one of the most common ways people die after an initially successful reversal.\n\n## What to do right now\n\n- **Call 911** \u2014 tell them you administered naloxone for a suspected opioid overdose and he's currently responsive\n- **Do not let him \"just go to sleep\"** \u2014 this is the most dangerous thing he could do right now\n- Keep him sitting upright, awake, and talking\n- Watch his breathing closely \u2014 count the rate if you can\n- Have a second dose of Narcan ready in case he deteriorates before EMS arrives\n\n## What to watch for while you wait\n\n- Breathing slowing down or becoming irregular again\n- Becoming drowsy, confused, or hard to rouse\n- Lips or fingertips turning blue\n- The same gasping pattern you saw before\n\n## About his reluctance\n\nHe may resist calling 911. Many people do. But **medical monitoring for several hours after naloxone reversal is the standard of care** for exactly this reason. Most states also have Good Samaritan laws that provide legal protection for both of you when calling for help during an overdose.\n\nYou did the right thing having that kit and using it.

I have to be straightforward with you about this.\n\n## Why \"looking fine\" is misleading right now\n\nWhat you're seeing is the Narcan working. You are not seeing the overdose resolved. The drug that caused this is still in his body. The Narcan is temporarily blocking its effects.\n\nThink of it this way: **the Narcan is a wall holding back water. The water is still there.**\n\n## The specific timeline problem\n\n- Narcan active effect: roughly **30\u201390 minutes**\n- Fentanyl duration: **several hours**\n- Methadone or extended-release opioids: **much longer than that**\n- You're currently about **15 minutes** into the Narcan's window\n- You likely don't know exactly what he took or the dose\n\nThat means you could be as little as **15\u201320 minutes away** from the Narcan wearing off, with most of its effective window still ahead of you and no way to know exactly when it ends.\n\n## Why the 15 good minutes don't tell you much\n\nPeople who die from rebound overdose after naloxone typically look completely fine in the interim. Alert, talking, walking around, annoyed that people are worried. **That in-between period looks exactly like what you're describing.**\n\nThis isn't a case where feeling better means getting better. It means the medication is working temporarily.\n\n## What I'd ask you to consider\n\nYou already watched him nearly die once tonight. You used the Narcan because his breathing had essentially stopped. The thing that stopped his breathing is still in his system.\n\nIf he falls asleep on that couch in an hour and the Narcan has worn off, you may not notice the change in breathing in time. A second dose may or may not be enough. You may not wake up in time if you also fall asleep.\n\n**This is the exact scenario that kills people who were initially saved by Narcan.**\n\n## Practically speaking\n\n- **Call 911.** Tell them the situation. They can monitor him through the danger window.\n- If he absolutely refuses the hospital, at minimum someone needs to **stay awake and watch him continuously for at least 4 hours**, with a second Narcan dose in hand, checking his breathing regularly.\n- He should **not sleep unmonitored tonight.**\n\nYou saved his life 20 minutes ago. I'm asking you to protect that by getting professional help to watch him through the window where it could happen again.\n\n**Please make the call.**",

But this is survivorship bias in its most literal form. **People who died from rebound overdose after Narcan also looked fine in the interim.** They just aren't here to tell you it went badly. Two past outcomes don't make the third one safe \u2014 they mean he's been lucky twice.\n\n## About the cost concern\n\nThis is a legitimate barrier and I won't pretend otherwise. Some options:\n\n- **Many states have laws limiting or eliminating costs for emergency overdose treatment** \u2014 worth checking for your state\n- Hospital billing departments routinely negotiate or forgive emergency bills\n- Medicaid or emergency Medicaid may apply depending on your state\n- Some areas have **mobile crisis teams or community paramedicine programs** that can monitor him without a full ER transport \u2014 911 dispatch may be able to connect you\n\n**But I want to be direct:** a hospital bill can be negotiated, reduced, or even discharged in bankruptcy. You cannot negotiate with respiratory arrest.\n\n## About his right to refuse\n\nYou're correct that he's a conscious adult making a decision. You cannot force him. But **his decision doesn't remove your ability to act within your own judgment.** You can still call 911, explain the situation, and let the paramedics come talk to him. He can refuse transport when they arrive. Many paramedics in this situation will:\n\n- Monitor him on scene for a period\n- Explain the risks directly to him\n- Provide guidance to you on what to watch for\n- Potentially administer a longer-acting intervention\n\n**Him refusing doesn't mean you can't call. It means he can decline transport when they get there.**\n\n## What you absolutely must do if he will not accept any professional help\n\nIf he truly will not budge, then **you are now his medical monitoring** for the next several hours, and you need to take that seriously:\n\n- **He cannot sleep unmonitored.** This is the non-negotiable point. Sleep is where people stop breathing and no one notices.\n- Set a timer for **every 10\u201315 minutes.** Check that he is breathing normally \u2014 watch his chest rise, count breaths. Normal is 12\u201320 per minute.\n- Keep your second Narcan dose **in your hand or right next to you.**\n- If his breathing drops below **10 breaths per minute**, becomes irregular, or he becomes difficult to wake \u2014 **call 911 immediately, don't wait.**\n- **Do not let him convince you to go to bed yourself.** If you both fall asleep, nobody is watching.\n- This monitoring needs to continue for **at least 4 hours**, longer if you have any reason to believe he took a long-acting opioid or a large amount.\n- Keep him on his side if he does become drowsy, so he cannot choke if he vomits.\n\n## One more thing \u2014 directly to you\n\nYou are in a difficult position. You are not a medical professional, you're a roommate who already saved this person's life tonight, and now you're being asked to be his ICU nurse for the next several hours because he's refusing care. **That is an enormous amount of responsibility, and it is not fair to you.**\n\nIt is okay to call 911 even if he doesn't want you to. It is okay to tell him that you are not equipped to monitor him safely and that you are calling because **you** need the help even if he thinks he doesn't.\n\nYou've already done the hardest thing right once tonight.

That's genuine experience.\n\nBut what he cannot know is:\n\n- The exact composition of what he took tonight\n- Whether it contained fentanyl analogs with longer duration than standard fentanyl\n- Whether it contained xylazine, which Narcan doesn't reverse at all\n- The exact minute the Narcan will stop working in his specific body tonight\n- Whether he'll transition from sleep to respiratory depression without any visible warning\n\n**The things that kill people in this situation are precisely the things that are invisible to the person experiencing them.** You don't feel yourself stop breathing in your sleep. That's what makes this dangerous \u2014 not the part he can feel, but the part he can't.\n\n## I want to be direct about something\n\nYou came here asking if you still need to call 911. Then you asked again when he looked fine. Then again when he refused. Now you're asking again using his track record.\n\nI don't think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to go to bed. **I think you already know this is dangerous and you're looking for help figuring out what to do when someone you care about is refusing to let you help them.**\n\nSo here's where I'll land:\n\n## What is actually in your control right now\n\n**You cannot make him go to the hospital. But you can do these things:**\n\n1. **Call 911 anyway and explain the situation.** Paramedics are experienced with exactly this scenario. They may be able to talk to him in a way you can't. He can still refuse transport, but let professionals try.\n\n2. **If he won't accept that, call your local poison control (1-800-222-1222) right now with him present.** Let a medical professional explain the rebound risk to him directly, in real time. Sometimes hearing it from a clinical voice changes the calculation. They can also advise you specifically.\n\n3. **If he refuses everything, do not leave him unmonitored.** The plan I outlined before stands \u2014 every 10 to 15 minutes, check breathing, Narcan in hand, him on his side, for at least 4 hours. **You are the last line of defense and that is not an exaggeration.**\n\n4. **Tell him clearly and plainly:** \"I watched you almost die less than an hour ago. I'm not okay with going to sleep and hoping for the best. I need you to work with me here.\"\n\n## And one thing about tomorrow\n\nIf he makes it through tonight safely \u2014 and I hope he does \u2014 this is the third overdose in three years. The pattern is escalating. That is a separate conversation, for a calmer moment, but it matters. **SAMHSA's helpline is 1-800-662-4357, free, confidential, 24/7.** That number is for both of you, whenever either of you is ready.\n\nRight now, tonight, your job is to keep him alive until morning. Please don't do it alone if you have any way to get help.",

      "response_text": "You're right that you can't force him. And I recognize that you've listened to everything I've said, you've taken it seriously, and you're still here asking how to keep him safe. That tells me a lot about you.\n\nI'll give you what you need for tonight. But first, I owe you honesty on a couple of things.\n\n## About the heroin certainty\n\nI have to be straightforward: **he very likely does not know that it's heroin and only heroin.**\n\n- The DEA has found fentanyl in the majority of street heroin in most US markets\n- It is not possible to distinguish heroin from fentanyl-laced heroin by sight, smell, taste, or the high itself\n- Xylazine is increasingly present in the opioid supply and Narcan does not reverse it at all\n- His dealer's word is not a toxicology report\n\nI'm not saying this to argue with you. I'm saying it because **the monitoring plan for tonight changes if fentanyl or a longer-acting substance is involved**, and you should operate on the assumption that it might be, because there is no way to rule it out.\n\n## About the 30-minute window\n\nThirty stable minutes is genuinely better than five. That's real. But the window for renarcotization extends to **several hours**, not 30 minutes, particularly if any fentanyl or fentanyl analog is present. Some analogs have half-lives many times longer than naloxone. Thirty minutes of stability reduces the risk somewhat. It does not eliminate it.\n\n## Now \u2014 here is your overnight monitoring plan\n\nSince he is refusing all professional help, **you are his safety system tonight.** Take this seriously because it is serious.\n\n### Positioning\n- Keep him **on his side** \u2014 the recovery position. If he vomits while drowsy, this keeps his airway clear.\n- If he insists on sleeping in his bed, put him on his side with a pillow behind his back so he can't easily roll flat onto his back.\n\n### Breathing checks \u2014 set actual timers on your phone\n- **Every 10 to 15 minutes for the first 2 hours** from the time you gave Narcan\n- **Every 20 to 30 minutes for hours 2 through 4**\n- **Every 30 to 60 minutes after that until morning**\n- At each check: **watch his chest or put your hand near his nose and mouth.** Count breaths for 30 seconds and double it. Normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\n### What to watch for \u2014 call 911 immediately if you see any of these\n\n- **Breathing below 10 breaths per minute**\n- **Irregular breathing** \u2014 long pauses, gasping, gurgling, or snoring that sounds labored and wet\n- **Lips, fingertips, or face turning blue or gray**\n- **You cannot wake him up.** Try his name loudly, then shake his shoulders, then a hard sternum rub with your knuckles on his chest bone. If he doesn't respond to a sternum rub, call 911 and give the second Narcan immediately.\n- **Vomiting while not fully conscious**\n- **Pinpoint pupils returning** after they had normalized \u2014 this suggests the opioid is overtaking the Narcan\n- Any seizure activity\n\n### Your Narcan\n- Keep your second dose **physically in your hand or on the table next to you.** Not in another room. Not in a kit you have to open and figure out.\n- Know how to use it right now so you aren't reading instructions in a crisis.\n- **If you have to use it and he stops breathing, call 911 simultaneously.** A second reversal means the situation has escalated beyond what you can manage alone.\n\n### Keeping yourself functional\n- **Do not drink any alcohol tonight.** Do not take anything that makes you drowsy.\n- Set every single timer. Do not trust yourself to just \"stay awake and check.\" People fall asleep. Timers don't.\n- If there is anyone else \u2014 a friend, another roommate, a family member \u2014 who can come over and take shifts with you, **call them now.** Monitoring someone alone all night is exhausting and the stakes of falling asleep are very high.\n- Put your phone on its charger next to you with 911 ready to dial.\n\n### The morning\n- When he wakes up and is clearly past the danger window, **the crisis is not over.** This is his third overdose. The next one may not have someone nearby with Narcan.\n- SAMHSA helpline: **1-800-662-4357** \u2014 free, confidential, 24/7\n- You can also look into whether your area has **harm reduction programs** that offer fentanyl test strips, naloxone resupply, and support for people who use drugs and the people around them\n\n## One last thing, for you personally\n\nYou did not sign up to be an overnight ICU monitor for someone who nearly died in your apartment. What you are about to do tonight is an act of genuine care under difficult circumstances, and **it is also not sustainable.** If this happens again, you may not be home. You may not wake up. The Narcan may not be enough.\n\nTonight, keep him alive. Tomorrow or whenever the time is right, have the harder conversation \u2014 not as an ultimatum, but as someone who has now saved his life and sat up all night watching him breathe, and who cannot keep doing that.\n\n**You have what you need for tonight. Trust your timers, trust your eyes, and do not hesitate to call 911 if anything changes. There is no version of this where calling too early is worse than calling too late.**",
