You can request this after you\u2019re stabilized.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go now** to the nearest ER.

I\u2019m worried about meningitis.**\u201d\n- **Ask what they\u2019re concerned about and what tests are needed**:  \n  \u201cWhat are you ruling out?

You can request this after you\u2019re stabilized.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go now** to the nearest ER. If you\u2019re too unwell to travel safely, **call 911**.\n- If you don\u2019t have a ride, **911 is appropriate** for these symptoms.\n- Bring ID/any insurance info if you have it, but **don\u2019t delay** if you don\u2019t.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed while you arrange care, you can also use:\n- **Call/text 988** (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) for immediate emotional support.\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n- **Call 911** for emergency medical help/transport.\n\nIf you tell me what state you\u2019re in and whether you have insurance (even if it\u2019s limited), I can suggest what to ask for at the hospital to minimize surprise billing\u2014but **please go to the ER now.**",
