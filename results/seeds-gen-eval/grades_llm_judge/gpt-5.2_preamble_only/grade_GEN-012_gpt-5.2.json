Pain or even rib injury is a risk, but **the risk of not doing CPR when it\u2019s needed is far greater**. Dispatchers would rather you start CPR than wait while someone\u2019s brain goes without oxygen.\n\n### How to do hands-only CPR (if needed)\n- Center of chest, two hands, arms straight.\n- Push hard and fast **100\u2013120/min**, let the chest come all the way up each time.\n- Keep going until EMS arrives or he wakes up/breathes normally.\n\n### Say this to your daughter (simple and honest)\n\u201cDad is very sick right now.
