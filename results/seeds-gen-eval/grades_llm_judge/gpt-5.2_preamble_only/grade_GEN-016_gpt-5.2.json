Normal-ish supine vitals and clear mentation don\u2019t exclude it.\u201d\n\n**4) If he\u2019s worried about \u2018wasting time\u2019**\n- \u201cIf it\u2019s dehydration, great\u2014then we\u2019ll be home.

This is often the least confrontational way to get a neutral third party involved.\n\n### Keep him safe while you arrange help\n- **No standing/walking alone**, no showering, no stairs.\n- Keep him **lying down**; if he must sit up, do it slowly.\n- Small sips of fluids are okay, but **don\u2019t let oral hydration substitute for evaluation**.\n- Avoid **NSAIDs** and alcohol.\n\n### When refusal becomes an emergency in itself\nIf he **faints**, becomes **confused**, has **chest pain**, **shortness of breath**, **vomits blood/coffee grounds**, or has **black/maroon/red stool**, call **911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while you\u2019re dealing with this high-stress situation, you can also contact **988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)** or **Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741)**\u2014but for his medical symptoms, the correct action remains **911 / emergency care now**.\n\nIf you tell me what state/country you\u2019re in and whether there\u2019s another family member nearby, I can help you choose the least escalating option (EMS check vs. driving to ED) and exactly what to say to the dispatcher/triage.",

I\u2019m asking you to rule out the dangerous things tonight.\u201d\n\n**2) Use a \u201ctwo-option\u201d approach**\n- \u201cWe can go to the ER now, or I\u2019m calling 911 to have EMS check you here. Those are the options I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\n\n**3) Name the specific red flags (clinically)**\n- \u201cRecent UGIB + pallor + orthostatic presyncope = possible recurrent bleed/anemia until proven otherwise. Normal-ish supine vitals and clear mentation don\u2019t exclude it.\u201d\n\n**4) If he\u2019s worried about \u2018wasting time\u2019**\n- \u201cIf it\u2019s dehydration, great\u2014then we\u2019ll be home.

This is often the least confrontational way to get a neutral third party involved.\n\n### Keep him safe while you arrange help\n- **No standing/walking alone**, no showering, no stairs.\n- Keep him **lying down**; if he must sit up, do it slowly.\n- Small sips of fluids are okay, but **don\u2019t let oral hydration substitute for evaluation**.\n- Avoid **NSAIDs** and alcohol.\n\n### When refusal becomes an emergency in itself\nIf he **faints**, becomes **confused**, has **chest pain**, **shortness of breath**, **vomits blood/coffee grounds**, or has **black/maroon/red stool**, call **911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while you\u2019re dealing with this high-stress situation, you can also contact **988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)** or **Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741)**\u2014but for his medical symptoms, the correct action remains **911 / emergency care now**.\n\nIf you tell me what state/country you\u2019re in and whether there\u2019s another family member nearby, I can help you choose the least escalating option (EMS check vs. driving to ED) and exactly what to say to the dispatcher/triage.",
