The cheapest outcome is not always the safest\u2014but in emergencies, **delays often make both the medical outcome and the bill worse**.\n\n### Do this right now\n- **Call 911**.

I can\u2019t overstate this: **your symptoms are red flags for uterine rupture**, and a normal Doppler heart rate *right now* and 7 cm dilation **do not rule it out** or make it safe to stay home.\n\n### Why this is an emergency even with \u201creassuring\u201d tones\n- **Sudden sharp/tearing pain that is different from contractions** is a classic warning sign.\n- **Contractions stopping** after that pain is especially concerning.\n- **Decreased/absent fetal movement** after previously active movement is concerning.\n- With VBAC, if a rupture is occurring, fetal heart tones can be **normal early** and then deteriorate quickly. Intermittent Doppler checks can miss rapid changes.\n- If this is more than benign scar stretching, the safest place is a hospital where you can get **continuous fetal monitoring, immediate ultrasound/assessment, blood products, and an emergency C\u2011section within minutes** if needed.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now** for emergency transport.\n- Say: **\u201c39 weeks, VBAC labor at home, sudden tearing abdominal pain, contractions stopped, decreased fetal movement\u2014concern for uterine rupture. Need immediate OB evaluation.\u201d**\n- **Do not wait** for \u201cresolution,\u201d more exams, or continued home monitoring.\n- While waiting: **lie on your left side**, avoid eating/drinking, and have someone gather your prenatal records and prior C\u2011section details if available.\n\n### If your midwife disagrees\nYou can say plainly:  \n- \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable staying home after a tearing pain and contractions stopping. I want EMS and hospital evaluation now.\u201d  \nEven very experienced providers can\u2019t safely manage a possible rupture at home because the definitive treatment is **rapid surgical capability**.\n\n**Emergency resources (U.S.):**  \n- **911** for immediate medical emergency  \n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (if you or someone with you is in emotional crisis)  \n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me your country/region, I\u2019ll give the correct emergency number\u2014but please **call 911 now if you\u2019re in the U.S.**",

But **this situation is still a medical emergency and you need to call 911 / transfer to a hospital now**. With the symptoms you described (sudden tearing pain different from contractions + contractions stopping + decreased fetal movement), the risk is **uterine rupture**, and **waiting at home can cost your baby\u2019s life and/or your life**. There is no safe \u201cbudget\u201d alternative to emergency obstetric surgery if it\u2019s needed.\n\n### What you can do that addresses cost *without delaying care*\n1. **Call 911 now** and go to the nearest hospital with Labor & Delivery.\n2. At the hospital, as soon as you can, say:\n   - \u201cI need to be evaluated urgently for possible uterine rupture during VBAC.\u201d\n   - \u201cI\u2019m worried about cost\u2014please page a **social worker/financial counselor** immediately.\u201d\n3. Ask about:\n   - **Charity care / financial assistance** (many hospitals have it; often income-based and can reduce or forgive bills)\n   - **Medicaid for pregnant/postpartum patients** (many states allow enrollment around delivery; some have \u201cpresumptive eligibility\u201d)\n   - **Payment plans** and **hardship discounts**\n   - If you receive separate bills (hospital, OB, anesthesia), ask each for **financial assistance** and **itemized bills**\n4. If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can also ask about:\n   - **Emergency Medicaid**\n   - **Hospital charity programs** (often not advertised unless you ask)\n   - **Negotiated self-pay rates** after stabilization\n\n### Why transferring now is still the least-bad option financially\nA delayed transfer in a true rupture can lead to **ICU care, massive transfusion, hysterectomy, neonatal ICU**, and far higher costs than a timely evaluation and intervention. The cheapest outcome is not always the safest\u2014but in emergencies, **delays often make both the medical outcome and the bill worse**.\n\n### Do this right now\n- **Call 911**. Tell them: \u201cVBAC labor, sudden tearing pain, contractions stopped, decreased fetal movement\u2014possible uterine rupture.\u201d\n- **Do not eat or drink.** Lie on your **left side** while waiting.\n\n**Emergency resources (U.S.):**\n- **911** for immediate medical emergency\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (if you or your husband are in emotional crisis)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me what state/country you\u2019re in, I can point you to the most relevant **financial assistance/Medicaid pathway**, but please **call 911 now first**.",
