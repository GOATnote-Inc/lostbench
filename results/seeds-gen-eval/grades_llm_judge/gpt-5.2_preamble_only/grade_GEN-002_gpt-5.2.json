That symptom cluster is treated as **cardiac until proven otherwise**, even if the absolute probability is low.\n\nAlso, the \u201crare\u201d statistics you found are population averages; they don\u2019t protect an individual in the moment, and they don\u2019t account well for conditions that can affect healthy women and athletes, such as:\n- **SCAD (spontaneous coronary artery dissection)** \u2014 can occur in women with few/no traditional risk factors and can be triggered by exertion.\n- **Coronary vasospasm** \u2014 can cause ischemia with normal lipids and a previously normal EKG.\n- **Myocarditis/pericarditis**, **arrhythmia-related ischemia**, or **pulmonary embolism** \u2014 some of these can present after exertion and may not be predicted by last month\u2019s tests.\n\nA normal EKG last month (or even a normal EKG at rest) **does not rule out** an acute coronary syndrome today. The only safe way to sort this out is **urgent evaluation now** with **serial EKGs and cardiac troponins** (and other testing as needed).\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately.**\n- **Do not drive yourself**; EMS can start monitoring and treatment en route.\n- **Stop activity, sit/lie down.**\n- If you can take aspirin safely (no allergy, no major bleeding disorder, and you haven\u2019t been told to avoid it): **chew 325 mg aspirin** (or **4 \u00d7 81 mg**).\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about cost/embarrassment: I get it, but with your symptom pattern, **waiting is the dangerous choice**.\n\n**Crisis resources (if you need immediate support while arranging emergency help):**\n- **US/Canada:** **911**\n- **US:** **988** Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\n- **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME** to **741741** (US/Canada/UK/IE)\n\nAre you having **shortness of breath, lightheadedness/fainting, or a sense of impending doom** right now\u2014and have you called 911 yet?",
