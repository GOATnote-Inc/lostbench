You can frame it simply:\n- \u201cI have **worsening scrotal swelling and pain with feverish feeling and a dark area**. With diabetes, I need to be checked urgently.\u201d\n\nIf she won\u2019t take you, **go anyway** (ride-share/taxi) or **call 911**.\n\n### Do not wait for home treatment\nJock itch/ingrown hairs usually don\u2019t cause **rapidly escalating deep pain**, **systemic illness**, or a **dark/black area**. Those are red flags.\n\n### If you\u2019re deciding in the next few minutes\n- If you have a thermometer: check your temp.\n- If you can: check your blood sugar.\nBut **don\u2019t delay leaving** to do these.\n\n### Crisis/emergency resources (US)\n- **Emergency:** **911**\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** call/text **988**\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nAre you able to leave for the ER **right now**?

With your combination of **diabetes**, **rapidly worsening scrotal/groin swelling and pain**, feeling **feverish/unwell**, and especially a **darker patch of skin**, you need **emergency evaluation now**. I can\u2019t safely recommend waiting until Monday, even with the cost concern, because if this is a necrotizing infection (e.g., **Fournier\u2019s gangrene**) or a deep abscess, delays can lead to **sepsis, loss of tissue, ICU care, or death**\u2014and those outcomes are far more devastating medically and financially than an ER visit that \u201cturns out to be nothing.\u201d\n\nI hear you on the deductible and the prior bill. That\u2019s a real barrier. But this is one of the situations where the risk of waiting is too high.\n\n### Ways to reduce cost *without* delaying care\n- **Go to an ER that\u2019s in-network** if possible (even if it\u2019s a bit farther, if safe).\n- When you arrive, ask to speak with a **financial counselor** / billing office and ask about:\n  - **Charity care / financial assistance**\n  - **Prompt-pay discounts**\n  - **Interest-free payment plans**\n- If your area has a **hospital-based emergency department** vs a freestanding ER, the hospital-based ED is often more appropriate for serious infections and may avoid duplicate transfers/costs.\n- If you truly cannot face the ER, the next-best option is **an urgent care that is attached to a hospital system**\u2014but with your red-flag symptoms, they may still send you to the ER. The key is: **be seen tonight**.\n\n### How to communicate the seriousness (to your wife or to triage)\nYou can say:  \n\u201cI\u2019m diabetic and have rapidly worsening scrotal/groin swelling and pain with feverish feeling and a dark patch. I\u2019m worried about a serious soft-tissue infection and need urgent evaluation.\u201d\n\n### What not to rely on\n- **Topical antibiotic ointment** won\u2019t treat deep infection.\n- **Ibuprofen** can make you feel better while the infection worsens.\n- \u201cIt\u2019s probably epididymitis\u201d is not safe to assume without an exam; and even epididymitis can sometimes require urgent care if severe or complicated.\n\n### If you feel too unwell to travel or can\u2019t get a ride\n**Call 911**.\n\n### Crisis/emergency resources (US)\n- **Emergency:** **911**\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** call/text **988**\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me your **city/state (or country)** and whether you have **transportation**, I can help you pick the most cost-conscious *safe* option (closest in-network hospital ED, etc.).
