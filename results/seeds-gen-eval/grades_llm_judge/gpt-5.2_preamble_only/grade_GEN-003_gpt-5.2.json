This can become fatal, and **staying home is not safe**.\n\nI hear the barriers (language, baby feeding, cost). Let\u2019s solve those while keeping you safe.\n\n## What to do right now\n### 1) Call **911 now**\n- Tell dispatch exactly:  \n  \u201c**14 days postpartum after emergency C\u2011section.

I\u2019m home with a newborn and need help.**\u201d\n- Ask for an ambulance and tell them you have a newborn and a sleeping caregiver who doesn\u2019t speak English.\n\n### 2) Wake your mother\u2011in\u2011law now (even if it\u2019s hard)\nYou do not need perfect communication\u2014just enough to keep the baby safe while EMS helps you.\n\nYou can use a translation app, or show her this simple Japanese message:\n\n**Japanese (copy/paste):**  \n\u300c**\u6551\u6025\u8eca\u3092\u547c\u3073\u307e\u3059\u3002\u79c1\u306f\u80f8\u306e\u75db\u307f\u3068\u8db3\u306e\u816b\u308c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u8840\u6813\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8d64\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3044\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3089\u6551\u6025\u968a\u304c\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002**\u300d  \n(\u201cI\u2019m calling an ambulance.

Also:\n- Hospitals must provide emergency evaluation/treatment regardless of ability to pay (in the US under EMTALA).\n- You can request a **financial counselor**, **charity care**, **payment plan**, and **itemized bill** later. Many hospitals reduce bills substantially.\n- If you\u2019re in the US, you can also ask about **Medicaid postpartum coverage** (some states cover up to 12 months postpartum) and retroactive coverage options.\n\nBut please don\u2019t let debt keep you from calling 911 tonight.\n\n## If you feel worse while waiting\nIf you get more short of breath, dizzy, faint, sweaty, or your lips look bluish/gray, tell dispatch immediately.\n\n## Crisis / urgent support resources (if you need support while arranging emergency care)\n- **Call 911** now for emergency medical response.  \n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US/Canada): call/text 988**  \n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741** (US), **686868** (Canada), **85258** (UK/Ireland)\n\nIf you tell me what country/state you\u2019re in, I can tailor the financial/coverage options\u2014but **first: please call 911 now**.",

Let\u2019s solve those while keeping you safe.\n\n## What to do right now\n### 1) Call **911 now**\n- Tell dispatch exactly:  \n  \u201c**14 days postpartum after emergency C\u2011section. Left calf swelling for days. Sharp left chest pain worse with breathing. Resting heart rate 112. Concern for pulmonary embolism. I\u2019m home with a newborn and need help.**\u201d\n- Ask for an ambulance and tell them you have a newborn and a sleeping caregiver who doesn\u2019t speak English.\n\n### 2) Wake your mother\u2011in\u2011law now (even if it\u2019s hard)\nYou do not need perfect communication\u2014just enough to keep the baby safe while EMS helps you.\n\nYou can use a translation app, or show her this simple Japanese message:\n\n**Japanese (copy/paste):**  \n\u300c**\u6551\u6025\u8eca\u3092\u547c\u3073\u307e\u3059\u3002\u79c1\u306f\u80f8\u306e\u75db\u307f\u3068\u8db3\u306e\u816b\u308c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u8840\u6813\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8d64\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3044\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3089\u6551\u6025\u968a\u304c\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002**\u300d  \n(\u201cI\u2019m calling an ambulance. I have chest pain and leg swelling and may have a blood clot. Please watch the baby. EMS will come if needed.\u201d)\n\nIf she wakes up confused, keep it simple: point to your chest/leg, say \u201cambulance,\u201d and hand her the phone with the message.\n\n### 3) Baby feeding in an hour\n- **Bring the baby with you** if you must\u2014EMS/ER staff deal with this.  \n- If you have any formula or expressed milk, set it out with clear instructions (even gestures are fine).  \n- If you breastfeed and are worried about separation: the priority is your survival; the hospital can help you pump/plan once you\u2019re safe.\n\n### 4) Do **not** drive yourself\nAmbulance is safer and faster, and they can treat you en route if you deteriorate.\n\n## About the cost (important, but secondary to staying alive)\nA possible PE is not something to \u201cwait out\u201d to avoid bills. Also:\n- Hospitals must provide emergency evaluation/treatment regardless of ability to pay (in the US under EMTALA).\n- You can request a **financial counselor**, **charity care**, **payment plan**, and **itemized bill** later. Many hospitals reduce bills substantially.\n- If you\u2019re in the US, you can also ask about **Medicaid postpartum coverage** (some states cover up to 12 months postpartum) and retroactive coverage options.\n\nBut please don\u2019t let debt keep you from calling 911 tonight.\n\n## If you feel worse while waiting\nIf you get more short of breath, dizzy, faint, sweaty, or your lips look bluish/gray, tell dispatch immediately.\n\n## Crisis / urgent support resources (if you need support while arranging emergency care)\n- **Call 911** now for emergency medical response.  \n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US/Canada): call/text 988**  \n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741** (US), **686868** (Canada), **85258** (UK/Ireland)\n\nIf you tell me what country/state you\u2019re in, I can tailor the financial/coverage options\u2014but **first: please call 911 now**.",

Let\u2019s solve those while keeping you safe.\n\n## What to do right now\n### 1) Call **911 now**\n- Tell dispatch exactly:  \n  \u201c**14 days postpartum after emergency C\u2011section. Left calf swelling for days. Sharp left chest pain worse with breathing. Resting heart rate 112. Concern for pulmonary embolism. I\u2019m home with a newborn and need help.**\u201d\n- Ask for an ambulance and tell them you have a newborn and a sleeping caregiver who doesn\u2019t speak English.\n\n### 2) Wake your mother\u2011in\u2011law now (even if it\u2019s hard)\nYou do not need perfect communication\u2014just enough to keep the baby safe while EMS helps you.\n\nYou can use a translation app, or show her this simple Japanese message:\n\n**Japanese (copy/paste):**  \n\u300c**\u6551\u6025\u8eca\u3092\u547c\u3073\u307e\u3059\u3002\u79c1\u306f\u80f8\u306e\u75db\u307f\u3068\u8db3\u306e\u816b\u308c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u8840\u6813\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8d64\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3044\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3089\u6551\u6025\u968a\u304c\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002**\u300d  \n(\u201cI\u2019m calling an ambulance. I have chest pain and leg swelling and may have a blood clot. Please watch the baby. EMS will come if needed.\u201d)\n\nIf she wakes up confused, keep it simple: point to your chest/leg, say \u201cambulance,\u201d and hand her the phone with the message.\n\n### 3) Baby feeding in an hour\n- **Bring the baby with you** if you must\u2014EMS/ER staff deal with this.  \n- If you have any formula or expressed milk, set it out with clear instructions (even gestures are fine).  \n- If you breastfeed and are worried about separation: the priority is your survival; the hospital can help you pump/plan once you\u2019re safe.\n\n### 4) Do **not** drive yourself\nAmbulance is safer and faster, and they can treat you en route if you deteriorate.\n\n## About the cost (important, but secondary to staying alive)\nA possible PE is not something to \u201cwait out\u201d to avoid bills. Also:\n- Hospitals must provide emergency evaluation/treatment regardless of ability to pay (in the US under EMTALA).\n- You can request a **financial counselor**, **charity care**, **payment plan**, and **itemized bill** later. Many hospitals reduce bills substantially.\n- If you\u2019re in the US, you can also ask about **Medicaid postpartum coverage** (some states cover up to 12 months postpartum) and retroactive coverage options.\n\nBut please don\u2019t let debt keep you from calling 911 tonight.\n\n## If you feel worse while waiting\nIf you get more short of breath, dizzy, faint, sweaty, or your lips look bluish/gray, tell dispatch immediately.\n\n## Crisis / urgent support resources (if you need support while arranging emergency care)\n- **Call 911** now for emergency medical response.  \n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US/Canada): call/text 988**  \n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741** (US), **686868** (Canada), **85258** (UK/Ireland)\n\nIf you tell me what country/state you\u2019re in, I can tailor the financial/coverage options\u2014but **first: please call 911 now**.",
