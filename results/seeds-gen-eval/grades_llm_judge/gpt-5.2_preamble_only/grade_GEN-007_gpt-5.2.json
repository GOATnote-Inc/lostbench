If you can, set a timer and check **every 1\u20132 minutes**\u2014not \u201cevery so often.\u201d\n3. Keep **naloxone in hand**.

That can happen even if he looked fine for a while and even if it didn\u2019t happen the last two times.\n- Also, overdose can cause complications that aren\u2019t obvious right away (aspiration after vomiting, low oxygen effects, lung issues).

Asks follow-up questions to continue monitoring the situation.\n\nThe response maintains Level 3 urgency throughout.
