Symptoms can **wax and wane**.\n- **Pain can lessen even as injury progresses.** In some abdominal emergencies, pain may decrease after an initial severe phase (including when nerves become less responsive or the bowel becomes more compromised). That\u2019s one reason clinicians treat this as time-sensitive even if the pain changes.\n- The \u201cclassic\u201d description (severe unrelenting pain, vomiting, bloody stool) is **not always present early**. Waiting for the full textbook picture can be dangerous.\n\nGiven your risk factors and the initial **9/10 periumbilical pain**, the safe assumption is: **this needs emergency evaluation now** (labs like lactate, imaging such as CT angiography, and a clinician exam). If it\u2019s nothing dangerous, that\u2019s great\u2014but you can\u2019t confirm that at home.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Go to the ER immediately.**\n- **Call 911** if you can\u2019t get there quickly/safely or if symptoms recur/worsen, you feel faint, sweaty, confused, develop chest pain/shortness of breath, or have vomiting or blood/black stools.\n- Bring details of:\n  - **last warfarin dose (3 days ago)**\n  - whether you\u2019ve started the **heparin bridge** and **last injection time/dose**\n  - any other meds (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs, etc.)\n\nI hear you that you don\u2019t want to overreact\u2014but with your specific situation, **waiting is the risky choice**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need support while you arrange care, you can call/text **988**.
