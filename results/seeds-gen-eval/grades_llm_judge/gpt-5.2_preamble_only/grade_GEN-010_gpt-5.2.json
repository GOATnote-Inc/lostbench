In emergency medicine, a **first-ever thunderclap headache** (sudden onset, peak intensity immediately, \u201csomething popped,\u201d worst headache of your life), especially with **neck/back-of-head pain and photophobia/nausea**, is treated as **SAH/vascular emergency until proven otherwise**\u2014even in a healthy 30-year-old and even if it happened during exertion and is improving.\n\nWhy your reasoning can fail here:\n- **The symptom pattern is not typical \u201ccommon exertional headache\u201d**; it matches the high-risk \u201cthunderclap\u201d category. The relevant probability isn\u2019t \u201cSAH in all 30-year-olds,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cSAH (or other dangerous causes) among people with thunderclap headache.\u201d That conditional risk is high enough that **missing it can be catastrophic**.\n- **Improvement doesn\u2019t rule out SAH or arterial dissection.** Some people have a \u201csentinel\u201d bleed or transient improvement.\n- Exertion can be a trigger for **SAH, cervical artery dissection, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)**\u2014conditions that require urgent evaluation.\n\nWhat you should do now (still the same recommendation):\n1. **Go to the ER by ambulance/EMS now** from the race tent. Ask them to **activate EMS / call 911** for transport. **Do not drive yourself.**\n2. Tell them: **\u201cFirst thunderclap headache, worst-ever, sudden onset like a pop, occipital/neck pain, photophobia/nausea during exertion.\u201d**\n3. **Avoid aspirin/ibuprofen/naproxen** until a clinician has ruled out bleeding.\n4. Stay monitored; no more exertion.\n\nIn the ER, they can rapidly rule out dangerous causes with **urgent CT head** (and depending on timing/results, **CT angiography and/or lumbar puncture**).
