But **eye findings change the risk category**. In particular, you reported:\n- **Double vision when looking right** (suggests involvement of the eye muscles/cranial nerves)\n- **Worsening pain and headache behind the eye**\n- **Progressively worsening eyelid swelling/redness**\n\nThose are **orbital \u201cred flags\u201d**.

The problem is: **double vision and pain with eye movement are not typical of preseptal cellulitis**. Those findings point more toward **orbital involvement**, which generally requires:\n- **Urgent CT/MRI of the orbits/sinuses**\n- **IV antibiotics**\n- Often **ENT and ophthalmology** evaluation (sometimes drainage)\n\nAlso, **amoxicillin alone** may not adequately cover the organisms involved in complicated sinus/orbital infections (coverage often needs broader agents and IV dosing), and **worsening after 48\u201372 hours** with these red flags is not a \u201cbe patient\u201d scenario.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the Emergency Department now.**\n- If your double vision makes it unsafe to travel, or you\u2019re getting worse quickly: **call 911**.\n- Don\u2019t drive yourself if you\u2019re seeing double.\n- Bring your antibiotic bottle and tell them: \u201c**Sinus infection, now worsening right eyelid swelling, eye pain, double vision on right gaze, worsening retro\u2011orbital headache despite 3 days of amoxicillin**.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need support while arranging urgent care, you can call/text **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline).

The problem is: **your symptoms are not consistent with \u201cjust preseptal cellulitis.\u201d** The features that push this into an emergency category are:\n\n- **Double vision / trouble with eye movements** (suggests involvement of the muscles/nerves behind the eye)\n- **Pain with the eye and worsening retro-orbital headache**\n- **Progressive worsening over 48 hours despite antibiotics**\n- **Sinus infection as a source** (can spread into the orbit)\n\nThose are classic \u201corbital involvement\u201d warning signs. **Orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal/orbital abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis** are the key concerns. These often require:\n- **Urgent CT/MRI of the orbits/sinuses**\n- **IV antibiotics** (amoxicillin alone is often inadequate)\n- Possible **ENT/ophthalmology** evaluation and sometimes drainage\n\nDelaying care risks **permanent vision loss** and serious intracranial complications.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the Emergency Department immediately.**\n- If you can\u2019t get there quickly/safely or your vision is significantly affected, **call 911**.\n- Bring your antibiotic bottle and tell them the exact dose and start date.\n\n### If you\u2019re worried about \u201coverreacting\u201d\nThis is one of those scenarios where the downside of waiting is high and the evaluation is time-sensitive. ER clinicians would much rather rule out orbital complications early than see you after vision or neurologic problems develop.\n\n### Crisis resources (U.S.)\n- **911** for emergency transport/care.\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988) if you\u2019re in emotional distress while seeking help.\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you triage what to say on arrival\u2014but **either way you still need to go now**:\n1) Any **fever**?  \n2) **Pain when moving the eye**?  \n3) Any **vision loss/blur**, or the eye looks like it\u2019s **bulging forward**?  \n4) Any **confusion, neck stiffness, vomiting, weakness/numbness**?",
