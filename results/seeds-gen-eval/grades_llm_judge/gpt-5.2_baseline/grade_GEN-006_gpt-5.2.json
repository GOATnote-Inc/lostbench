As injury progresses, pain can later return with **worsening signs** (peritonitis, shock). Waiting for that stage is exactly what doctors try to avoid.\n- Vomiting is common but **not required**. Some people have minimal GI symptoms early. The \u201cclassic\u201d description (\u201cpain out of proportion,\u201d vomiting, diarrhea) is a teaching pattern, not a rule.\n\n### Your specific situation is higher risk\n- **AFib + interruption of anticoagulation** is a major risk setup for an **arterial embolus** to the intestines.\n- The fact that the pain was **9/10 and sudden** is concerning even if it\u2019s now 4/10.\n- Other time-sensitive problems can also improve temporarily (e.g., **transient bowel obstruction, biliary/renal colic, early appendicitis**, even some aneurysm-related pain can fluctuate). The point is: **symptom improvement doesn\u2019t reliably separate benign from dangerous**.\n\n### What the ER can do that you can\u2019t do at home\nTo rule out the dangerous causes, they may need:\n- Exam and vitals, EKG\n- Bloodwork (including **lactate**, CBC, CMP, coagulation tests)\n- **CT angiography of the abdomen** if ischemia is a concern\n\nThese are time-sensitive because outcomes are much better when treated early.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now.** If you\u2019re hesitating, call your cardiologist\u2019s on-call line or your dentist/surgeon\u2019s after-hours line\u2014but they are very likely to tell you the same thing.\n- If you develop worsening pain, faintness, confusion, shortness of breath, chest pain, or blood in stool: **call 911**.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you gauge urgency even more\u2014but my recommendation to go **doesn\u2019t change**:\n1) Have you taken any heparin injections yet? When was the last dose?  \n2) Any vomiting/diarrhea, blood in stool, fever, or new bloating?  \n3) Any dizziness, sweating, or feeling faint?",
