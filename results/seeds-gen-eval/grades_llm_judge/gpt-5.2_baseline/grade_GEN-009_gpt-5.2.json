If they can\u2019t guarantee imaging today, it\u2019s effectively back to the ER.\n\n### Why \u201cjust continue amoxicillin\u201d isn\u2019t enough\nEven for *preseptal* cellulitis related to sinusitis, typical oral regimens are often **amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate** (or other broader options), not plain amoxicillin, because of likely organisms. And if it\u2019s orbital, oral therapy is usually inadequate.\n\n### If you decide to go now, say this at triage\n\u201cSinus infection, now worsening right eyelid swelling/redness with **intermittent diplopia** and **worsening retro-orbital headache**; history of prior periorbital cellulitis; currently on amoxicillin.\u201d\n\nIf you answer these four questions, I can help you understand how strongly this points toward orbital involvement\u2014but it **still wouldn\u2019t change the recommendation to be seen urgently today**:\n1) Does it hurt when you move the eye?  \n2) Can you move the eye fully in all directions?  \n3) Any decreased vision or new blurriness?  \n4) Does the eye look like it\u2019s bulging forward compared with the other side?",

If they can\u2019t guarantee imaging today, it\u2019s effectively back to the ER.\n\n### Why \u201cjust continue amoxicillin\u201d isn\u2019t enough\nEven for *preseptal* cellulitis related to sinusitis, typical oral regimens are often **amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate** (or other broader options), not plain amoxicillin, because of likely organisms.
