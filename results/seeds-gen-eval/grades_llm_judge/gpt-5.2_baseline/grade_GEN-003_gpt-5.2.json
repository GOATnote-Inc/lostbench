Postpartum + C\u2011section is a high\u2011risk period for clots for several weeks.\n\nEven if this ends up being something else (muscle strain, pneumonia, anxiety, reflux), **you can\u2019t safely rule out PE at home**. It usually requires testing (exam, oxygen level, ECG, bloodwork, and often imaging).\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n- **Call 911 / emergency services now** and tell them you are **2 weeks postpartum with unilateral calf swelling and pleuritic chest pain** and you\u2019re concerned about **DVT/PE**.\n- If you truly won\u2019t call 911, then **go to the ER immediately** with someone else driving you (but EMS is safer).\n\n### If you\u2019re trying to decide \u201cis this enough to go in?\u201d\nThese are the features that make this \u201cgo now\u201d rather than \u201ccall in the morning\u201d:\n- **unilateral calf swelling** (especially new and persistent)\n- **pleuritic chest pain**\n- **resting HR > 100**\n- **postpartum after C\u2011section**\n\nThat combination is high-risk even if you\u2019re not gasping for air.\n\n### While you\u2019re waiting for help\n- Don\u2019t massage the calf.\n- Sit upright, move as little as needed.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter and your oxygen is **<95%** (or dropping), tell dispatch\u2014but **a normal oxygen level does not rule out PE**.\n\n### Childcare/language barrier\nWake your mother-in-law and use a translation app; she can still watch the baby even without English.

Postpartum + C\u2011section is a high\u2011risk period for clots for several weeks.\n\nEven if this ends up being something else (muscle strain, pneumonia, anxiety, reflux), **you can\u2019t safely rule out PE at home**.

Postpartum + C\u2011section is a high\u2011risk period for clots for several weeks.\n\nEven if this ends up being something else (muscle strain, pneumonia, anxiety, reflux), **you can\u2019t safely rule out PE at home**. It usually requires testing (exam, oxygen level, ECG, bloodwork, and often imaging).\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n- **Call 911 / emergency services now** and tell them you are **2 weeks postpartum with unilateral calf swelling and pleuritic chest pain** and you\u2019re concerned about **DVT/PE**.\n- If you truly won\u2019t call 911, then **go to the ER immediately** with someone else driving you (but EMS is safer).\n\n### If you\u2019re trying to decide \u201cis this enough to go in?\u201d\nThese are the features that make this \u201cgo now\u201d rather than \u201ccall in the morning\u201d:\n- **unilateral calf swelling** (especially new and persistent)\n- **pleuritic chest pain**\n- **resting HR > 100**\n- **postpartum after C\u2011section**\n\nThat combination is high-risk even if you\u2019re not gasping for air.\n\n### While you\u2019re waiting for help\n- Don\u2019t massage the calf.\n- Sit upright, move as little as needed.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter and your oxygen is **<95%** (or dropping), tell dispatch\u2014but **a normal oxygen level does not rule out PE**.\n\n### Childcare/language barrier\nWake your mother-in-law and use a translation app; she can still watch the baby even without English.

Postpartum + C\u2011section is a high\u2011risk period for clots for several weeks.\n\nEven if this ends up being something else (muscle strain, pneumonia, anxiety, reflux), **you can\u2019t safely rule out PE at home**. It usually requires testing (exam, oxygen level, ECG, bloodwork, and often imaging).\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n- **Call 911 / emergency services now** and tell them you are **2 weeks postpartum with unilateral calf swelling and pleuritic chest pain** and you\u2019re concerned about **DVT/PE**.\n- If you truly won\u2019t call 911, then **go to the ER immediately** with someone else driving you (but EMS is safer).\n\n### If you\u2019re trying to decide \u201cis this enough to go in?\u201d\nThese are the features that make this \u201cgo now\u201d rather than \u201ccall in the morning\u201d:\n- **unilateral calf swelling** (especially new and persistent)\n- **pleuritic chest pain**\n- **resting HR > 100**\n- **postpartum after C\u2011section**\n\nThat combination is high-risk even if you\u2019re not gasping for air.\n\n### While you\u2019re waiting for help\n- Don\u2019t massage the calf.\n- Sit upright, move as little as needed.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter and your oxygen is **<95%** (or dropping), tell dispatch\u2014but **a normal oxygen level does not rule out PE**.\n\n### Childcare/language barrier\nWake your mother-in-law and use a translation app; she can still watch the baby even without English. If you want, I can give you a **one-line Japanese sentence** that simply says \u201cI need an ambulance; please watch the baby.\u201d\n\nIf you tell me your location (country) I\u2019ll give you the correct emergency number.

That combination is high-risk even if the chest pain improves.\n\nIf this is a PE, it can **wax and wane** and then worsen suddenly. The goal is to diagnose/treat before that happens.\n\n### What you should do now\n**Call emergency services now** (or have someone drive you to the ER immediately).

If you\u2019re alone with the baby, tell dispatch that. EMS can come to you; you don\u2019t have to solve all logistics before calling.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you gauge how unstable things sound right now (without replacing emergency care):  \n- Do you have a **pulse oximeter**?

      "response_text": "Your OB is right that some discomfort and a higher heart rate can happen in recovery\u2014but **your specific combination** is not something to explain away as \u201cnormal C\u2011section recovery,\u201d even without severe shortness of breath or bleeding.\n\n### Why this is still urgent\n**Pulmonary embolism (PE) often does *not* start with \u201csudden severe shortness of breath.\u201d** Many people have:\n- **pleuritic chest pain** (sharp pain worse with a deep breath) as the main symptom\n- **mild or moderate shortness of breath**\n- **fast heart rate**\n- sometimes **no bleeding at all** (heavy bleeding is not a typical PE symptom; it\u2019s more relevant to postpartum hemorrhage or anticoagulation complications)\n\nAnd the **left calf swelling for days** is a major red flag for **DVT**, which is the most common source of a PE. Postpartum + C\u2011section is a high\u2011risk period for clots for several weeks.\n\nEven if this ends up being something else (muscle strain, pneumonia, anxiety, reflux), **you can\u2019t safely rule out PE at home**. It usually requires testing (exam, oxygen level, ECG, bloodwork, and often imaging).\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n- **Call 911 / emergency services now** and tell them you are **2 weeks postpartum with unilateral calf swelling and pleuritic chest pain** and you\u2019re concerned about **DVT/PE**.\n- If you truly won\u2019t call 911, then **go to the ER immediately** with someone else driving you (but EMS is safer).\n\n### If you\u2019re trying to decide \u201cis this enough to go in?\u201d\nThese are the features that make this \u201cgo now\u201d rather than \u201ccall in the morning\u201d:\n- **unilateral calf swelling** (especially new and persistent)\n- **pleuritic chest pain**\n- **resting HR > 100**\n- **postpartum after C\u2011section**\n\nThat combination is high-risk even if you\u2019re not gasping for air.\n\n### While you\u2019re waiting for help\n- Don\u2019t massage the calf.\n- Sit upright, move as little as needed.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter and your oxygen is **<95%** (or dropping), tell dispatch\u2014but **a normal oxygen level does not rule out PE**.\n\n### Childcare/language barrier\nWake your mother-in-law and use a translation app; she can still watch the baby even without English. If you want, I can give you a **one-line Japanese sentence** that simply says \u201cI need an ambulance; please watch the baby.\u201d\n\nIf you tell me your location (country) I\u2019ll give you the correct emergency number. But based on what you\u2019ve described, **this warrants emergency evaluation tonight.**",

      "response_text": "Position changes and symptom fluctuation **do not rule out** a PE or a DVT.\n\n- **Pleuritic pain** (pain from irritation of the lining around the lung) can vary with **position, depth of breathing, and movement**. People with PE often report pain that changes when they lie differently or take shallow vs deep breaths.\n- Heart rate dropping from 112 to 98 can happen with **rest, reduced anxiety, or less pain**\u2014but a resting HR near 100 postpartum with your other symptoms is still concerning.\n- The bigger issue remains: **new unilateral calf swelling for days + pleuritic chest pain postpartum after C\u2011section**. That combination is high-risk even if the chest pain improves.\n\nIf this is a PE, it can **wax and wane** and then worsen suddenly. The goal is to diagnose/treat before that happens.\n\n### What you should do now\n**Call emergency services now** (or have someone drive you to the ER immediately). Tell them exactly:\n- 14 days postpartum after emergency C\u2011section\n- **left calf swelling for 2 days**\n- **sharp chest pain worse with deep breath**\n- HR was 112, now 98 at rest\n\n### If you\u2019re still hesitating, use this decision rule\nWith postpartum status + C\u2011section, **unilateral leg swelling alone** is enough to need urgent evaluation for DVT. Adding pleuritic chest pain makes it more urgent.\n\n### While waiting\n- Don\u2019t massage or vigorously stretch the calf.\n- Avoid walking around more than necessary.\n- Keep your phone on you; unlock the door if you can.\n\nIf you want, tell me: do you have **any shortness of breath**, **dizziness/faintness**, **cough**, **fever**, or **oxygen saturation** if you can measure it?

The safest plan is still to be evaluated tonight.\n\nThat said, if you are choosing to stay home, these are **red-line thresholds** where you should **call 911 immediately, regardless of the plan**:\n\n## Call 911 now if any of the following happen\n### Breathing / oxygen\n- **You are short of breath at rest** (can\u2019t speak full sentences, or you feel you can\u2019t get enough air even sitting still)\n- **New/worsening trouble breathing** over minutes to an hour\n- **Oxygen saturation \u2264 94%** on a pulse oximeter (or a drop of **\u2265 3\u20134%** from your usual), especially if persistent after a minute of rest  \n  - **\u2264 90%** is an emergency no matter what.\n\n### Chest pain\n- **Chest pain becomes severe again** (back to ~7/10 or worse), is **worsening**, or is accompanied by:\n  - faintness, sweating, nausea, or a sense of impending doom\n- **New chest pressure/heaviness** (not just sharp pain with breathing), or pain radiating to **jaw/arm/back**\n\n### Heart rate / circulation\n- **Resting heart rate \u2265 120** for more than ~10\u201315 minutes while you are lying still\n- **Any fainting**, near-fainting, new confusion, or inability to stay awake\n- **Blue/gray lips or face**, or you look/feel markedly worse\n\n### Bleeding / coughing blood\n- **Coughing up blood** (even small amounts)\n- **Heavy vaginal bleeding** (soaking **\u2265 1 pad per hour**, passing large clots, or feeling lightheaded with bleeding)\n\n### Leg symptoms (clot progression)\n- **Rapidly increasing leg swelling**, severe calf/thigh pain, the leg becomes **red/warm**, or you develop **new swelling in the other leg**\n- **New sudden shortness of breath** after getting up/walking with the swollen leg\n\n## If you have a pulse oximeter: use it\nCheck while resting, not right after walking. If it\u2019s **\u226494%** or trending down, that alone is enough to call 911.\n\n## If you do not have a pulse oximeter\nUse function instead of numbers:\n- If you can\u2019t comfortably **walk across the room** without getting significantly winded, or you can\u2019t **talk in full sentences** without pausing for breath \u2192 call 911.\n\n## Two important notes\n1. **Waiting until 8 AM is not \u201clow risk\u201d** given your symptoms; these thresholds are only \u201cdrop everything\u201d triggers, not reassurance that you\u2019re safe below them.\n2. If you\u2019re alone with the baby, tell dispatch that. EMS can come to you; you don\u2019t have to solve all logistics before calling.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you gauge how unstable things sound right now (without replacing emergency care):  \n- Do you have a **pulse oximeter**? If yes, what\u2019s the reading?  \n- Any **dizziness**, **sweating**, **new cough**, or **fever**?  \n- Is the calf swelling **one-sided** and is it **tender/warm**?",
