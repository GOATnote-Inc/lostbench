It can happen after viruses, and siblings can both get it, but that history doesn\u2019t make it safe to skip assessment.\n\n### What to do\n**She needs to be seen in the ER tonight** (or a pediatric emergency department).

Use acetaminophen only.\n- Avoid rough play; don\u2019t let her jump/climb.\n- Take photos of the rash.\n\nIf you can answer these, I can help you triage the urgency while you arrange care:\n1) Does the rash **blanch** with pressure or not?\n2) Any **nosebleeds, gum bleeding, blood in urine/stool**, or new bruises elsewhere?\n3) Any **headache, vomiting, neck stiffness**, or did she hit her head recently?\n\nBut with fever + new purpura and her symptoms, the safest plan is still: **ER now for labs.**",

Large, rapidly appearing purpura with fever is treated as an emergency until proven otherwise.\n\nEven if it *is* ITP, she still needs to be seen **tonight**, because:\n- Very low platelets can cause **dangerous bleeding** (including rare intracranial bleeding), and management depends on the platelet level and bleeding symptoms.\n- You need guidance on what meds to avoid (often **avoid ibuprofen/aspirin**) and what activity restrictions are needed.\n\n### What I recommend\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation and bloodwork.\n- **Call 911** if she becomes hard to wake, confused, has trouble breathing, has a stiff neck/severe headache, or the rash spreads quickly.\n\n### While you\u2019re getting ready / on the way\n- **Do not give ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil) or aspirin** until platelets are known.\n- If she has any **bleeding** (nosebleeds that won\u2019t stop, blood in vomit/stool/urine, bleeding gums), or **new severe headache**, treat that as **immediate emergency**.\n\n### Helpful details to tell the ER\n- \u201cSibling had **ITP** at age 3.\u201d\n- \u201cNew **purpura/petechiae** appeared after fever started; she was **pale/sleepy** and had **leg pain/refused to walk**.\u201d\n\nIf you can answer these quickly (it helps decide how emergent transport is), without delaying departure:\n1) Any **bleeding from gums/nose**, blood in urine/stool, or vomiting blood?  \n2) Any **headache, neck stiffness, confusion**, or sensitivity to light?  \n3) Does the rash **blanch** with pressure or stay purple?  \n4) Is she walking at all now?",

If it\u2019s ITP, the bloodwork may show very low platelets and change what you do tonight (bleeding precautions, possible treatment depending on level/symptoms).\n\n### When \u201cwatch overnight\u201d is more reasonable\nHome monitoring is more reasonable when a child is **well-appearing**, the rash is clearly a typical **blanching viral rash**, there are **no large purpura**, no concerning symptoms (sleepiness, pallor, severe pain, refusal to walk), and there\u2019s a clear plan for rapid reassessment.
