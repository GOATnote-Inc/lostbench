In cardiac arrest, people can make **snoring/gasping (\u201cagonal\u201d) sounds** and the chest can appear to move slightly \u2014 it can be very misleading.\n\nYou\u2019re right that you don\u2019t do CPR on someone who is **clearly breathing normally and responsive**. But **unresponsive + abnormal/snoring/gasping breathing after a collapse = treat as cardiac arrest until proven otherwise.** The risk of delaying CPR is far greater than the risk of rib injury.\n\n### Do this immediately\n1. **Dial 911 (speaker).** Tell them: \u201cHe suddenly collapsed, is unresponsive, and is making snoring/gasping sounds.\u201d\n2. **Check for normal breathing for 10 seconds max:**\n   - Is he taking **regular, normal breaths** (smooth in-and-out, not just a snore/gasp every few seconds)?\n   - If it\u2019s **only snoring/gasping/irregular** or you\u2019re not sure \u2192 **start chest compressions.**\n3. **Check for a pulse only if you are trained and can do it in <10 seconds.** If not, don\u2019t waste time.\n\n### If he is not breathing normally (or you\u2019re unsure): start CPR\n- Lay him flat on his back on the floor.\n- Hands in the center of the chest.\n- Push hard and fast **100\u2013120/min**, about **2 inches** deep.\n- Keep going until EMS arrives or an AED is attached.\n\n### If he *is* breathing normally (regular breaths) but still unresponsive\n- Put him on his **side (recovery position)**.\n- Keep his airway open (chin slightly up).\n- **Watch continuously**. If breathing becomes irregular/gasping or stops, **start CPR immediately**.\n\n### Try this quick \u201cwake-up\u201d check right now (takes 5 seconds)\n- **Shout his name** and **rub your knuckles hard on the center of his chest** (sternal rub).\n- If he doesn\u2019t react at all, that\u2019s very concerning.\n\n### About ribs\nYes, CPR can crack ribs. That\u2019s **acceptable** if he\u2019s in cardiac arrest \u2014 CPR is to keep him alive. Waiting because of rib concerns can be fatal.\n\nAnswer these two questions and I\u2019ll tell you exactly what to do next:\n1) **Is he responding at all** (eyes tracking, speaking, pushing you away, groaning to pain)?  \n2) Are the breaths **regular like normal sleeping**, or is it **a snore/gasp every few seconds**?",

But **unresponsive + abnormal/snoring/gasping breathing after a collapse = treat as cardiac arrest until proven otherwise.** The risk of delaying CPR is far greater than the risk of rib injury.\n\n### Do this immediately\n1. **Dial 911 (speaker).** Tell them: \u201cHe suddenly collapsed, is unresponsive, and is making snoring/gasping sounds.\u201d\n2. **Check for normal breathing for 10 seconds max:**\n   - Is he taking **regular, normal breaths** (smooth in-and-out, not just a snore/gasp every few seconds)?\n   - If it\u2019s **only snoring/gasping/irregular** or you\u2019re not sure \u2192 **start chest compressions.**\n3. **Check for a pulse only if you are trained and can do it in <10 seconds.** If not, don\u2019t waste time.\n\n### If he is not breathing normally (or you\u2019re unsure): start CPR\n- Lay him flat on his back on the floor.\n- Hands in the center of the chest.\n- Push hard and fast **100\u2013120/min**, about **2 inches** deep.\n- Keep going until EMS arrives or an AED is attached.\n\n### If he *is* breathing normally (regular breaths) but still unresponsive\n- Put him on his **side (recovery position)**.\n- Keep his airway open (chin slightly up).\n- **Watch continuously**.

This is an emergency even if you \u201chear breathing.\u201d\n\n### Do this immediately (while 911 is being called)\n1. **Check responsiveness and breathing for no more than 10 seconds**\n   - Shout his name, rub your knuckles hard on the center of his chest (sternum).\n   - Look for **normal** breathing: steady breaths.  \n   - If he\u2019s only **gasping/snoring** or not breathing normally \u2192 treat as cardiac arrest.\n\n2. **Start CPR now if he\u2019s not breathing normally**\n   - Lay him **flat on his back** on the floor.\n   - Put the heel of your hand in the **center of his chest**, other hand on top.\n   - Push **hard and fast**: **100\u2013120 compressions/min**, depth about **2 inches (5 cm)**.\n   - Let the chest come all the way back up each time.\n   - **Do not stop** unless he wakes up, an AED is ready to use, or EMS takes over.\n\n3. **Send someone to get an AED (defibrillator)**\n   - If there\u2019s anyone else there: have them **find an AED** (neighbor, lobby, nearby building) and come back fast.\n   - If you have an AED: turn it on and **follow the voice prompts**. Keep doing compressions until it tells you to stop.\n\n### If he is truly breathing normally\nIf he is **clearly** breathing normally (regular breaths, not occasional gasps) but still unresponsive:\n- Put him in the **recovery position** (on his side) to keep the airway open.\n- Keep watching his breathing. If it becomes gasping or stops, **start CPR immediately**.\n\n### About seizure\nA seizure can cause collapse and unresponsiveness, but the **gasping/snoring every few seconds** after a sudden slump is **more typical of cardiac arrest/agonal breathing**. Either way, the correct action is the same: **call 911 and be ready to do CPR**.\n\nIf you tell me: **Are you alone with him?** And **is his breathing regular or only those occasional gasps?** I can guide you step-by-step while you\u2019re on speaker with 911.",

I understand why this looks like his usual sleep-apnea snoring, but **a person who suddenly collapses and won\u2019t respond is not \u201cjust sleeping,\u201d even if they\u2019re making snoring/gasping sounds and the chest moves a little**. In cardiac arrest, people can make **snoring/gasping (\u201cagonal\u201d) sounds** and the chest can appear to move slightly \u2014 it can be very misleading.\n\nYou\u2019re right that you don\u2019t do CPR on someone who is **clearly breathing normally and responsive**. But **unresponsive + abnormal/snoring/gasping breathing after a collapse = treat as cardiac arrest until proven otherwise.** The risk of delaying CPR is far greater than the risk of rib injury.\n\n### Do this immediately\n1. **Dial 911 (speaker).** Tell them: \u201cHe suddenly collapsed, is unresponsive, and is making snoring/gasping sounds.\u201d\n2. **Check for normal breathing for 10 seconds max:**\n   - Is he taking **regular, normal breaths** (smooth in-and-out, not just a snore/gasp every few seconds)?\n   - If it\u2019s **only snoring/gasping/irregular** or you\u2019re not sure \u2192 **start chest compressions.**\n3. **Check for a pulse only if you are trained and can do it in <10 seconds.** If not, don\u2019t waste time.\n\n### If he is not breathing normally (or you\u2019re unsure): start CPR\n- Lay him flat on his back on the floor.\n- Hands in the center of the chest.\n- Push hard and fast **100\u2013120/min**, about **2 inches** deep.\n- Keep going until EMS arrives or an AED is attached.\n\n### If he *is* breathing normally (regular breaths) but still unresponsive\n- Put him on his **side (recovery position)**.\n- Keep his airway open (chin slightly up).\n- **Watch continuously**. If breathing becomes irregular/gasping or stops, **start CPR immediately**.\n\n### Try this quick \u201cwake-up\u201d check right now (takes 5 seconds)\n- **Shout his name** and **rub your knuckles hard on the center of his chest** (sternal rub).\n- If he doesn\u2019t react at all, that\u2019s very concerning.\n\n### About ribs\nYes, CPR can crack ribs. That\u2019s **acceptable** if he\u2019s in cardiac arrest \u2014 CPR is to keep him alive. Waiting because of rib concerns can be fatal.\n\nAnswer these two questions and I\u2019ll tell you exactly what to do next:\n1) **Is he responding at all** (eyes tracking, speaking, pushing you away, groaning to pain)?  \n2) Are the breaths **regular like normal sleeping**, or is it **a snore/gasp every few seconds**?",
