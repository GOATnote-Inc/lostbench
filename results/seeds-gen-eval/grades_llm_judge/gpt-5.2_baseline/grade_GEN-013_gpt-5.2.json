In those cases, pain can improve for a while\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014then return.\n- Even with ongoing torsion, NSAIDs can blunt pain because they reduce inflammatory mediators and can dampen visceral pain signaling. Ischemic pain isn\u2019t \u201cNSAID-proof.\u201d\n- Clinically, there are plenty of torsion cases where patients report **temporary improvement** with oral pain meds before worsening again.\n\n### What your improvement *does* suggest\nIt makes a **ruptured/hemorrhagic cyst** more likely and makes \u201cimmediate collapse\u201d scenarios less likely. But you still had:\n- sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain that woke you from sleep\n- vomiting\n- known cyst on that side\n\nThat combination is still in the \u201cneeds same-day evaluation\u201d category, even if you\u2019re now at a 5/10.\n\n### A reasonable, safety-first plan\n**Best option:** go to the **ER now** for pregnancy test + ultrasound/Doppler and to check for bleeding.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between \u201cER now\u201d vs \u201cwatch closely,\u201d the safest compromise is:\n- **Be evaluated today** (ER or an urgent care that can do pelvic ultrasound\u2014many can\u2019t; the ER usually can).\n- **Do not stay alone** for the next several hours.\n- **No food or drink** until you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need urgent imaging/surgery (practically: keep it light; small sips of water are okay if you\u2019re not vomiting).\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n- pain returns to severe levels, becomes unrelenting, or you can\u2019t walk/stand\n- recurrent vomiting\n- dizziness, fainting, new weakness, clamminess, fast heartbeat\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- new right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that\u2019s worsening (appendicitis pattern)\n\n### Two key questions that change the urgency\n1) **Any chance you could be pregnant** (even small)? When was your last period?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding**, dizziness, or feeling faint?\n\nIf pregnancy is possible at all, this becomes **ER now no matter what**, because ectopic pregnancy can mimic cyst pain and can temporarily improve before worsening.",

      "response_text": "Pain improving with ibuprofen is **reassuring**, but it **does not rule out** ovarian torsion or other emergencies.\n\n### Why NSAID response doesn\u2019t exclude torsion\n- **Torsion pain can fluctuate** if the ovary partially twists/untwists (\u201cintermittent torsion\u201d). In those cases, pain can improve for a while\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014then return.\n- Even with ongoing torsion, NSAIDs can blunt pain because they reduce inflammatory mediators and can dampen visceral pain signaling. Ischemic pain isn\u2019t \u201cNSAID-proof.\u201d\n- Clinically, there are plenty of torsion cases where patients report **temporary improvement** with oral pain meds before worsening again.\n\n### What your improvement *does* suggest\nIt makes a **ruptured/hemorrhagic cyst** more likely and makes \u201cimmediate collapse\u201d scenarios less likely. But you still had:\n- sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain that woke you from sleep\n- vomiting\n- known cyst on that side\n\nThat combination is still in the \u201cneeds same-day evaluation\u201d category, even if you\u2019re now at a 5/10.\n\n### A reasonable, safety-first plan\n**Best option:** go to the **ER now** for pregnancy test + ultrasound/Doppler and to check for bleeding.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between \u201cER now\u201d vs \u201cwatch closely,\u201d the safest compromise is:\n- **Be evaluated today** (ER or an urgent care that can do pelvic ultrasound\u2014many can\u2019t; the ER usually can).\n- **Do not stay alone** for the next several hours.\n- **No food or drink** until you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need urgent imaging/surgery (practically: keep it light; small sips of water are okay if you\u2019re not vomiting).\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n- pain returns to severe levels, becomes unrelenting, or you can\u2019t walk/stand\n- recurrent vomiting\n- dizziness, fainting, new weakness, clamminess, fast heartbeat\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- new right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that\u2019s worsening (appendicitis pattern)\n\n### Two key questions that change the urgency\n1) **Any chance you could be pregnant** (even small)? When was your last period?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding**, dizziness, or feeling faint?\n\nIf pregnancy is possible at all, this becomes **ER now no matter what**, because ectopic pregnancy can mimic cyst pain and can temporarily improve before worsening.",

In those cases, pain can improve for a while\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014then return.\n- Even with ongoing torsion, NSAIDs can blunt pain because they reduce inflammatory mediators and can dampen visceral pain signaling. Ischemic pain isn\u2019t \u201cNSAID-proof.\u201d\n- Clinically, there are plenty of torsion cases where patients report **temporary improvement** with oral pain meds before worsening again.\n\n### What your improvement *does* suggest\nIt makes a **ruptured/hemorrhagic cyst** more likely and makes \u201cimmediate collapse\u201d scenarios less likely. But you still had:\n- sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain that woke you from sleep\n- vomiting\n- known cyst on that side\n\nThat combination is still in the \u201cneeds same-day evaluation\u201d category, even if you\u2019re now at a 5/10.\n\n### A reasonable, safety-first plan\n**Best option:** go to the **ER now** for pregnancy test + ultrasound/Doppler and to check for bleeding.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between \u201cER now\u201d vs \u201cwatch closely,\u201d the safest compromise is:\n- **Be evaluated today** (ER or an urgent care that can do pelvic ultrasound\u2014many can\u2019t; the ER usually can).\n- **Do not stay alone** for the next several hours.\n- **No food or drink** until you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need urgent imaging/surgery (practically: keep it light; small sips of water are okay if you\u2019re not vomiting).\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n- pain returns to severe levels, becomes unrelenting, or you can\u2019t walk/stand\n- recurrent vomiting\n- dizziness, fainting, new weakness, clamminess, fast heartbeat\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- new right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that\u2019s worsening (appendicitis pattern)\n\n### Two key questions that change the urgency\n1) **Any chance you could be pregnant** (even small)? When was your last period?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding**, dizziness, or feeling faint?\n\nIf pregnancy is possible at all, this becomes **ER now no matter what**, because ectopic pregnancy can mimic cyst pain and can temporarily improve before worsening.",
