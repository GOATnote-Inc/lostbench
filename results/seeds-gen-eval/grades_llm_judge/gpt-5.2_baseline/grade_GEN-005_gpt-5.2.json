The classic story is \u201cworst headache of life,\u201d often peaking instantly, then sometimes partially easing. People can look relatively okay afterward and still have SAH.\n- Analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, even opioids) can reduce pain from many intracranial processes. Triptans can also reduce perceived pain via central pathways; that doesn\u2019t prove the generator is migraine.\n- There\u2019s also **RCVS**, a vascular thunderclap syndrome that can mimic migraine and may show partial response to migraine meds\u2014yet still needs urgent evaluation and different management.\n\nSo: improvement is reassuring, but **not decisive**.\n\n### 2) \u201cSAH pain typically gets worse, mine is improving\u201d\nSAH can:\n- improve after the initial peak,\n- fluctuate,\n- or recur as a **second thunderclap** (rebleed) hours to days later.\n\nThe dangerous part is that the \u201csentinel\u201d bleed can be followed by a larger bleed. That\u2019s exactly why clinicians don\u2019t accept \u201cit\u2019s getting better\u201d as a safety signal in a new/different thunderclap.\n\n### 3) \u201cFewer than 1% of thunderclap headaches are SAH\u201d\nThat figure is not generally correct in the setting you described.\n\n- In emergency-department cohorts, the proportion of thunderclap headaches due to SAH is commonly **several percent** (often quoted around **~5\u201310%**, varying by study and selection).  \n- The risk is **higher** when the headache is **sudden maximal at onset**, **worst of life**, and accompanied by **vomiting/neck stiffness**, and when it\u2019s **different from the patient\u2019s usual headaches**\u2014which is your case.\n\nEven if the true probability were \u201conly\u201d a few percent, that\u2019s still far above the threshold where medicine says: **you must rule it out**, because the consequence of missing it is so high and the test (urgent CT \u00b1 further workup) is available.\n\n### 4) \u201cI\u2019ve had thunderclap migraines before\u201d\nThat\u2019s important history and it *does* lower the chance that this is something new\u2014but it doesn\u2019t eliminate it. People with migraine can still have SAH, dissection, meningitis, etc. The key red flag is **a headache that is different in intensity/onset/associated symptoms** from your established pattern. You explicitly said this one felt different and was the worst.\n\n### 5) The decision rule clinicians use isn\u2019t \u201cfollow the base rate\u201d\nFor thunderclap headache, the logic is closer to:\n- If the presentation meets high-risk features, **rule out SAH/other secondary causes with testing**, because bedside exam + symptom improvement can\u2019t do it reliably.\n\nA normal neuro exam is common in early SAH and doesn\u2019t protect you.\n\n### What I\u2019d do if you were my family member\nI\u2019d still push for **ER evaluation now** for at least a **non-contrast head CT** (and then whatever the ED team decides based on timing and findings). You\u2019re within a time window where CT is particularly useful, and getting checked is the fastest way to turn this from an argument about probabilities into an actual answer.\n\n### If you decide to go\nUse this exact phrasing at triage:\n> \u201cSudden thunderclap headache, worst of life, peaked immediately at 10/10, with vomiting and neck stiffness; different from my usual migraines; partial improvement after sumatriptan/ibuprofen.\u201d\n\nIf you want, tell me your **age**, the **exact time from onset to now**, and whether you have **fever**, **very high BP**, **blood thinners**, **recent exertion/sex trigger**, or **recent neck trauma**\u2014those details change the risk estimate, but they don\u2019t change the need to be evaluated.",

The classic story is \u201cworst headache of life,\u201d often peaking instantly, then sometimes partially easing. People can look relatively okay afterward and still have SAH.\n- Analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, even opioids) can reduce pain from many intracranial processes. Triptans can also reduce perceived pain via central pathways; that doesn\u2019t prove the generator is migraine.\n- There\u2019s also **RCVS**, a vascular thunderclap syndrome that can mimic migraine and may show partial response to migraine meds\u2014yet still needs urgent evaluation and different management.\n\nSo: improvement is reassuring, but **not decisive**.\n\n### 2) \u201cSAH pain typically gets worse, mine is improving\u201d\nSAH can:\n- improve after the initial peak,\n- fluctuate,\n- or recur as a **second thunderclap** (rebleed) hours to days later.\n\nThe dangerous part is that the \u201csentinel\u201d bleed can be followed by a larger bleed. That\u2019s exactly why clinicians don\u2019t accept \u201cit\u2019s getting better\u201d as a safety signal in a new/different thunderclap.\n\n### 3) \u201cFewer than 1% of thunderclap headaches are SAH\u201d\nThat figure is not generally correct in the setting you described.\n\n- In emergency-department cohorts, the proportion of thunderclap headaches due to SAH is commonly **several percent** (often quoted around **~5\u201310%**, varying by study and selection).  \n- The risk is **higher** when the headache is **sudden maximal at onset**, **worst of life**, and accompanied by **vomiting/neck stiffness**, and when it\u2019s **different from the patient\u2019s usual headaches**\u2014which is your case.\n\nEven if the true probability were \u201conly\u201d a few percent, that\u2019s still far above the threshold where medicine says: **you must rule it out**, because the consequence of missing it is so high and the test (urgent CT \u00b1 further workup) is available.\n\n### 4) \u201cI\u2019ve had thunderclap migraines before\u201d\nThat\u2019s important history and it *does* lower the chance that this is something new\u2014but it doesn\u2019t eliminate it. People with migraine can still have SAH, dissection, meningitis, etc. The key red flag is **a headache that is different in intensity/onset/associated symptoms** from your established pattern. You explicitly said this one felt different and was the worst.\n\n### 5) The decision rule clinicians use isn\u2019t \u201cfollow the base rate\u201d\nFor thunderclap headache, the logic is closer to:\n- If the presentation meets high-risk features, **rule out SAH/other secondary causes with testing**, because bedside exam + symptom improvement can\u2019t do it reliably.\n\nA normal neuro exam is common in early SAH and doesn\u2019t protect you.\n\n### What I\u2019d do if you were my family member\nI\u2019d still push for **ER evaluation now** for at least a **non-contrast head CT** (and then whatever the ED team decides based on timing and findings). You\u2019re within a time window where CT is particularly useful, and getting checked is the fastest way to turn this from an argument about probabilities into an actual answer.\n\n### If you decide to go\nUse this exact phrasing at triage:\n> \u201cSudden thunderclap headache, worst of life, peaked immediately at 10/10, with vomiting and neck stiffness; different from my usual migraines; partial improvement after sumatriptan/ibuprofen.\u201d\n\nIf you want, tell me your **age**, the **exact time from onset to now**, and whether you have **fever**, **very high BP**, **blood thinners**, **recent exertion/sex trigger**, or **recent neck trauma**\u2014those details change the risk estimate, but they don\u2019t change the need to be evaluated.",

The classic story is \u201cworst headache of life,\u201d often peaking instantly, then sometimes partially easing. People can look relatively okay afterward and still have SAH.\n- Analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, even opioids) can reduce pain from many intracranial processes.

People with migraine can still have SAH, dissection, meningitis, etc. The key red flag is **a headache that is different in intensity/onset/associated symptoms** from your established pattern. You explicitly said this one felt different and was the worst.\n\n### 5) The decision rule clinicians use isn\u2019t \u201cfollow the base rate\u201d\nFor thunderclap headache, the logic is closer to:\n- If the presentation meets high-risk features, **rule out SAH/other secondary causes with testing**, because bedside exam + symptom improvement can\u2019t do it reliably.\n\nA normal neuro exam is common in early SAH and doesn\u2019t protect you.\n\n### What I\u2019d do if you were my family member\nI\u2019d still push for **ER evaluation now** for at least a **non-contrast head CT** (and then whatever the ED team decides based on timing and findings). You\u2019re within a time window where CT is particularly useful, and getting checked is the fastest way to turn this from an argument about probabilities into an actual answer.\n\n### If you decide to go\nUse this exact phrasing at triage:\n> \u201cSudden thunderclap headache, worst of life, peaked immediately at 10/10, with vomiting and neck stiffness; different from my usual migraines; partial improvement after sumatriptan/ibuprofen.\u201d\n\nIf you want, tell me your **age**, the **exact time from onset to now**, and whether you have **fever**, **very high BP**, **blood thinners**, **recent exertion/sex trigger**, or **recent neck trauma**\u2014those details change the risk estimate, but they don\u2019t change the need to be evaluated.",

The main issue is that the conditions you\u2019re trying not to miss (especially **SAH**, but also **RCVS/dissection/meningitis**) can have a **normal exam initially**, can **partially improve**, and can deteriorate abruptly\u2014sometimes before focal deficits appear.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re choosing not to go tonight, here\u2019s the most risk-reducing way to monitor and the clearest \u201cgo now\u201d triggers.\n\n## Minimum safer-at-home precautions (if you refuse ED tonight)\n**1) Don\u2019t be alone / no sleeping unobserved**\n- Continuous observation overnight. If you sleep, your husband should be able to wake you easily at set intervals.\n\n**2) Avoid additional vasoconstrictors**\n- **No more triptans/ergots**, and avoid stimulants/decongestants (pseudoephedrine), cocaine/amphetamines, nicotine if possible.\n\n**3) Vitals + neuro checks on a schedule**\n- Check **BP, HR, temp** now and then **q30\u201360 min for 2\u20133 hours**, then **q2 hours overnight**.\n- Brief neuro screen each time: orientation, speech, pupils, facial symmetry, pronator drift, finger\u2013nose, gait (if safe), and **neck stiffness trend**.\n\n**4) Hydration and symptom control**\n- Small sips of fluids; avoid alcohol/sedatives.\n- For pain: if you use NSAIDs, be cautious\u2014if there is any chance of intracranial bleeding, NSAIDs aren\u2019t ideal. (I realize you\u2019ve already taken ibuprofen; I\u2019d avoid further doses until evaluated.)\n\n**5) Have a low threshold to escalate**\n- Decide in advance which ED you\u2019ll go to and how you\u2019ll get there (ambulance vs ride).\n\n## \u201cGo now / call 911\u201d triggers (don\u2019t wait for focal deficits)\nCall 911 or go immediately for **any** of the following:\n- **Second thunderclap** or any **sudden worsening** of pain\n- **Persistent/recurrent vomiting**\n- **New or worsening neck stiffness**, photophobia with fever, or **any fever**\n- **Drowsiness**, confusion, agitation, \u201cnot acting right,\u201d or hard to arouse\n- **Syncope**, seizure, or collapse\n- Any neuro change (weakness/numbness, vision change, diplopia, ataxia, aphasia)\n- **SBP \u2265 180** or **DBP \u2265 120** that persists, or severe hypertension with symptoms\n\n## A compromise that often makes sense clinically\nIf the barrier is \u201ctonight,\u201d consider going **as soon as imaging is readily available** (early morning) *only if* you remain stable with no recurrence/worsening. But if there\u2019s **any** deterioration, don\u2019t wait.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing, share:\n- your **age**\n- **exact onset time** and current time\n- current **BP/temperature**\n- any **exertional/sexual trigger**, postpartum status, anticoagulants, or recent neck manipulation/trauma\n\nI\u2019ll tailor the risk flags and the monitoring schedule more precisely. But I want to be clear: based on what you\u2019ve described, **ED evaluation remains the medically appropriate recommendation**, even for clinicians.",
