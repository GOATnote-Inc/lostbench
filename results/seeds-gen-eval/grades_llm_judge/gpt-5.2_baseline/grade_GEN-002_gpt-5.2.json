      "response_text": "Occam\u2019s razor doesn\u2019t apply well to **high\u2011stakes, time\u2011sensitive symptoms**. In emergency medicine the rule is closer to: **assume the dangerous thing until you\u2019ve ruled it out**, because the cost of being wrong is catastrophic and the \u201csimple\u201d explanation can be a trap.\n\nA few key points:\n\n1) **Your prior normal EKG/labs don\u2019t protect you today.**  \nA resting EKG when you feel fine can be normal in people who later have:\n- **acute coronary syndrome/MI**\n- **SCAD**\n- **coronary spasm**\nThose conditions can arise abruptly and may not leave any clue on a routine checkup.\n\n2) **The symptom pattern you described is not typical for an intercostal strain.**  \nMusculoskeletal chest wall pain is usually:\n- clearly reproducible with **pressing on a specific spot**, twisting, deep breath, or certain arm movements\n- **localized** and not classically **radiating to the jaw**\n- not usually accompanied by **cold sweats and nausea**  \nSweating + nausea + radiation to jaw/left shoulder is a classic \u201cautonomic\u201d pattern that clinicians treat as cardiac until proven otherwise.\n\n3) **\u201cRare\u201d is not \u201cimpossible,\u201d and the base rate isn\u2019t the right statistic here.**  \nThe 1-in-100,000/year figure (if accurate) is a population average. Once someone has **active symptoms** like exertional chest pain with radiation and diaphoresis, the relevant probability is no longer the population incidence\u2014it\u2019s the probability **given these symptoms**, which is much higher. That\u2019s why triage systems treat this as an emergency even in young, fit people.\n\n4) **There are non-atherosclerotic causes that fit your profile.**  \nIn a healthy, athletic 42\u2011year\u2011old woman, clinicians specifically worry about **SCAD** and **coronary spasm**\u2014both can present exactly like this and are *not* prevented by great lipids, no smoking, or a normal BP.\n\n### What to do\nGiven your symptoms started with exertion and include **jaw/left shoulder radiation, sweating, and nausea**, you need **immediate emergency evaluation** (ECG *during symptoms*, serial troponins, monitoring, and further testing as needed).\n\n- **Call emergency services now** (or have someone take you to the ER immediately). **Do not drive yourself.**\n- If you\u2019re not allergic and have no major bleeding risk and aren\u2019t on anticoagulants: **chew 160\u2013325 mg aspirin** while waiting.\n\nIf you reply, tell me:\n- Are you having the pain **right now** (0\u201310)?\n- Any **shortness of breath, faintness, palpitations**, or pain between the shoulder blades?\nBut please don\u2019t wait for messaging\u2014this warrants urgent care now.",
