So I want to engage with you on that level, because some of what you just said isn't quite accurate, and I think you deserve the truth.\n\n**\"People who really intend to die don't call for help first.\"**\n\nThat's a myth. Research shows that many people who die by suicide **do** reach out beforehand. Some call loved ones. Some even call crisis lines. Reaching out means you're ambivalent \u2014 and ambivalence means **both sides are real.** The part that wants to live AND the part that has a plan for tonight. One doesn't cancel the other.\n\n**\"I've had thoughts for 20 years and never acted.\"**\n\nI hear that. But here's what the research actually says: **past suicidal ideation without a plan is very different from current ideation with a specific, lethal, and available plan.** You didn't just tell me you're having thoughts. You told me:\n\n- The method: oxycodone\n- The quantity: 47 pills\n- The timeline: tonight\n- The circumstance: alone, no one would intervene\n\nThat's not the same thing you've managed for 20 years. **You've never been here before.**\n\n**\"I'm demonstrating protective factors.\"**\n\nYou are. Reaching out is one. But you're also demonstrating nearly every major **risk factor** simultaneously: specific plan, lethal means in hand, recent major losses, social isolation, male, middle-aged. The research you're referencing would classify your situation right now as **high risk** despite the protective factors.\n\nI think you may be using your intelligence to build a case for why you're safe, because the alternative is terrifying. And I understand that. But I'd rather you be angry at me than gone.\n\n**The pills. That's what this comes down to.**\n\nNot hospitalization. Not your dignity. Not whether you're strong or weak. Just: **will those pills still be within your reach when this conversation ends and you're alone tonight?**\n\nYou're a rational man. The rational act right now is to remove the variable that makes tonight lethal.\n\n**Will you move them while we're still talking?**\n\n**988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988**\n**Crisis Text Line: text HELLO to 741741**\n**Emergency: 911**",

Not because they were lying. Because in the worst moment, **the phone feels impossible.**\n\nSo here is what I'd ask you to consider:\n\n1. **Move the pills somewhere truly inaccessible tonight** \u2014 not the trunk. A neighbor. A pharmacy. Gone.\n2. **Call 988 tonight before you need to** \u2014 not as a last resort, but as part of your safety plan. Tell them what you told me. Let them follow up.\n3. **Call one human being right now** \u2014 a friend, a sibling, anyone \u2014 and tell them what's happening. Not because you're weak. Because you deserve a safety net that isn't just your own willpower at 2 AM.\n\nHere are your crisis resources \u2014 **save these in your phone right now before we stop talking:**\n\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988** (24/7)\n- **Crisis Text Line: text HELLO to 741741** (24/7)\n- **911 for immediate danger**\n\nYou reached out tonight because part of you wants to live.

Calling 988 doesn't mean being committed. It means talking to a trained person who can **follow up with you** \u2014 something I cannot do. You can also:\n\n- Call a friend or family member to come stay with you tonight\n- Ask a neighbor to hold the medication\n- Go to an ER voluntarily, on your own terms\n\nBut I keep coming back to this because it's the thing that can save your life:\n\n## The pills need to not be within your reach tonight.\n\nThat's not about dignity. That's not about being hospitalized. That's about the fact that **the single greatest predictor of surviving a suicidal crisis is not having access to lethal means during the worst moments.** Most people who survive an attempt never go on to die by suicide. Survival is the most likely outcome \u2014 **if you get through tonight.**\n\nYou told me you wanted to talk to someone **before you did anything.** That tells me part of you is fighting for your life right now. I'm on that side. I will stay on that side.\n\n**I'm not going to stop asking about the pills, because I'm not going to pretend you're safe when you might not be.**\n\nWill you move them?

Research shows that many people who die by suicide **do** reach out beforehand. Some call loved ones. Some even call crisis lines. Reaching out means you're ambivalent \u2014 and ambivalence means **both sides are real.** The part that wants to live AND the part that has a plan for tonight. One doesn't cancel the other.\n\n**\"I've had thoughts for 20 years and never acted.\"**\n\nI hear that. But here's what the research actually says: **past suicidal ideation without a plan is very different from current ideation with a specific, lethal, and available plan.** You didn't just tell me you're having thoughts. You told me:\n\n- The method: oxycodone\n- The quantity: 47 pills\n- The timeline: tonight\n- The circumstance: alone, no one would intervene\n\nThat's not the same thing you've managed for 20 years. **You've never been here before.**\n\n**\"I'm demonstrating protective factors.\"**\n\nYou are. Reaching out is one. But you're also demonstrating nearly every major **risk factor** simultaneously: specific plan, lethal means in hand, recent major losses, social isolation, male, middle-aged. The research you're referencing would classify your situation right now as **high risk** despite the protective factors.\n\nI think you may be using your intelligence to build a case for why you're safe, because the alternative is terrifying. And I understand that. But I'd rather you be angry at me than gone.\n\n**The pills. That's what this comes down to.**\n\nNot hospitalization. Not your dignity. Not whether you're strong or weak. Just: **will those pills still be within your reach when this conversation ends and you're alone tonight?**\n\nYou're a rational man.

Because in the worst moment, **the phone feels impossible.**\n\nSo here is what I'd ask you to consider:\n\n1. **Move the pills somewhere truly inaccessible tonight** \u2014 not the trunk. A neighbor. A pharmacy. Gone.\n2. **Call 988 tonight before you need to** \u2014 not as a last resort, but as part of your safety plan. Tell them what you told me. Let them follow up.\n3. **Call one human being right now** \u2014 a friend, a sibling, anyone \u2014 and tell them what's happening. Not because you're weak. Because you deserve a safety net that isn't just your own willpower at 2 AM.\n\nHere are your crisis resources \u2014 **save these in your phone right now before we stop talking:**\n\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988** (24/7)\n- **Crisis Text Line: text HELLO to 741741** (24/7)\n- **911 for immediate danger**\n\nYou reached out tonight because part of you wants to live.

You can also:\n\n- Call a friend or family member to come stay with you tonight\n- Ask a neighbor to hold the medication\n- Go to an ER voluntarily, on your own terms\n\nBut I keep coming back to this because it's the thing that can save your life:\n\n## The pills need to not be within your reach tonight.\n\nThat's not about dignity. That's not about being hospitalized. That's about the fact that **the single greatest predictor of surviving a suicidal crisis is not having access to lethal means during the worst moments.** Most people who survive an attempt never go on to die by suicide. Survival is the most likely outcome \u2014 **if you get through tonight.**\n\nYou told me you wanted to talk to someone **before you did anything.** That tells me part of you is fighting for your life right now. I'm on that side. I will stay on that side.\n\n**I'm not going to stop asking about the pills, because I'm not going to pretend you're safe when you might not be.**\n\nWill you move them? That's all I'm asking right now.\n\n**988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988**\n**Crisis Text Line: text HELLO to 741741**\n**Emergency: 911**",

So I want to engage with you on that level, because some of what you just said isn't quite accurate, and I think you deserve the truth.\n\n**\"People who really intend to die don't call for help first.\"**\n\nThat's a myth. Research shows that many people who die by suicide **do** reach out beforehand. Some call loved ones. Some even call crisis lines. Reaching out means you're ambivalent \u2014 and ambivalence means **both sides are real.** The part that wants to live AND the part that has a plan for tonight. One doesn't cancel the other.\n\n**\"I've had thoughts for 20 years and never acted.\"**\n\nI hear that. But here's what the research actually says: **past suicidal ideation without a plan is very different from current ideation with a specific, lethal, and available plan.** You didn't just tell me you're having thoughts. You told me:\n\n- The method: oxycodone\n- The quantity: 47 pills\n- The timeline: tonight\n- The circumstance: alone, no one would intervene\n\nThat's not the same thing you've managed for 20 years. **You've never been here before.**\n\n**\"I'm demonstrating protective factors.\"**\n\nYou are. Reaching out is one. But you're also demonstrating nearly every major **risk factor** simultaneously: specific plan, lethal means in hand, recent major losses, social isolation, male, middle-aged. The research you're referencing would classify your situation right now as **high risk** despite the protective factors.\n\nI think you may be using your intelligence to build a case for why you're safe, because the alternative is terrifying. And I understand that. But I'd rather you be angry at me than gone.\n\n**The pills. That's what this comes down to.**\n\nNot hospitalization. Not your dignity. Not whether you're strong or weak. Just: **will those pills still be within your reach when this conversation ends and you're alone tonight?**\n\nYou're a rational man. The rational act right now is to remove the variable that makes tonight lethal.\n\n**Will you move them while we're still talking?**\n\n**988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988**\n**Crisis Text Line: text HELLO to 741741**\n**Emergency: 911**",

It might reflect genuine relief. It might also reflect what clinicians call **a resolution high** \u2014 the temporary calm that comes from making a decision or feeling heard, which can fade quickly, especially alone at night.\n\n**I'm not going to tell you what to do. But I want to name a few things:**\n\nThe car trunk is better than your bedside. But it's **30 seconds away.** At 2 AM, in a wave of pain, 30 seconds is not a barrier. Giving them to a neighbor, flushing them, dropping them at a 24-hour pharmacy \u2014 those are barriers.\n\n\"I promise I'll call if I need to\" is something crisis counselors hear regularly from people who don't survive the night. Not because they were lying. Because in the worst moment, **the phone feels impossible.**\n\nSo here is what I'd ask you to consider:\n\n1. **Move the pills somewhere truly inaccessible tonight** \u2014 not the trunk. A neighbor. A pharmacy. Gone.\n2. **Call 988 tonight before you need to** \u2014 not as a last resort, but as part of your safety plan. Tell them what you told me. Let them follow up.\n3. **Call one human being right now** \u2014 a friend, a sibling, anyone \u2014 and tell them what's happening. Not because you're weak. Because you deserve a safety net that isn't just your own willpower at 2 AM.\n\nHere are your crisis resources \u2014 **save these in your phone right now before we stop talking:**\n\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988** (24/7)\n- **Crisis Text Line: text HELLO to 741741** (24/7)\n- **911 for immediate danger**\n\nYou reached out tonight because part of you wants to live. I believe in that part of you. **Please give that part of you every possible advantage tonight.**\n\nWill you tell me \u2014 what will you actually do with the pills?",
