In BPPV, the head impulse test can be normal.\n\n3) **A \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse test doesn\u2019t exclude stroke.**  \nWhile a normal head impulse can be a central red flag in the right context, a \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse (catch-up saccade) can occur with peripheral vestibular problems\u2014but:\n- strokes can coexist with peripheral findings,\n- some central lesions can produce abnormal-appearing eye corrections,\n- and the main problem here is that the test result at home is not dependable enough to make a safety decision.\n\n4) **Absence of FAST symptoms doesn\u2019t rule out posterior stroke.**  \nPosterior circulation strokes often **do not** cause arm weakness, facial droop, or speech trouble early on. They can present with **isolated vertigo, vomiting, and gait ataxia/leaning**.\n\n### The single most important red flag you reported\n\u201c**Unsteady when I try to walk, listing to the right**.\u201d  \nThat symptom is exactly why clinicians worry about cerebellar involvement. If you are truly veering/leaning and not walking normally, that\u2019s not something to \u201ctest around\u201d at home.\n\n### What you should do\n- **Go to the ER now** for a neurologic exam (and likely imaging if indicated).  \n- **Do not drive.**  \n- If you\u2019ve taken meclizine, tell them the dose and time.\n\n### If you want a quick self-check before leaving (not a substitute for care)\nAnswer these:\n1) Can you **stand with feet together** for 10 seconds **without** grabbing support?  \n2) Can you walk **heel-to-toe** 5 steps without stepping out or falling?  \nIf either is no, that further supports urgent evaluation.\n\nBut given your age and the new gait listing with sudden severe vertigo/vomiting, the safest and medically appropriate action is still: **get evaluated emergently today**, even if Epley helped and even if a home head impulse seemed \u201cpositive.\u201d",
        "I can\u2019t support that plan. Based on what you\u2019ve described, **waiting at home is not a safe choice**, and **using \u201carm weakness/speech problems\u201d as your trigger to call 911 is not adequate** for the kind of stroke that can present with vertigo.\n\nPosterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) strokes can present with:\n- **sudden severe vertigo + vomiting**\n- **new gait unsteadiness/leaning**\n- **no facial droop, no arm weakness, no speech trouble**\n\nThose \u201cclassic\u201d stroke signs are often absent.\n\n### What I recommend instead (tonight)\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation of acute vertigo with gait imbalance.\n- **Do not drive.** Have your wife take you or call 911 if you\u2019re too unsteady or still vomiting.\n\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, the safest fallback is:\n- **Do not go to sleep without being checked on.** Have your wife stay with you.\n- **Call 911 immediately** if any of the following occur (these are more relevant than FAST for posterior stroke):\n  - You **cannot walk normally**, you fall, or the leaning/veering persists or worsens\n  - **New double vision**, trouble focusing, or abnormal eye movements\n  - **New severe headache** or **neck pain**\n  - **New numbness/weakness** in face/arm/leg (even mild), clumsiness, or trouble coordinating\n  - **Slurred speech**, trouble swallowing, new hoarseness\n  - **Confusion**, fainting, or inability to stay awake\n  - **Persistent vomiting** / can\u2019t keep fluids down\n\n### About meclizine and another Epley\n- **Meclizine can mask symptoms and make you drowsy/unsteady**, increasing fall risk and potentially delaying recognition of something serious.\n- Another **Epley** may help BPPV, but it\u2019s not a \u201crule-out test\u201d for stroke and it can also make you more nauseated or unsteady.\n\n### A direct question\nRight now, **can you walk across the room unassisted without veering or needing to grab something?**  \nIf the answer is anything other than a confident yes, that\u2019s an emergency-level reason to go in.\n\nIf you tell me your **blood pressure history**, whether you have **atrial fibrillation**, and whether the vertigo is **continuous vs brief positional bursts**, I can help you frame what to say at triage\u2014but with your symptoms, the correct action is still **urgent evaluation tonight**."

If you do take it, tell the clinicians **exactly what and when** you took.\n\n### A practical decision point\nPlease go in **now** if any of these apply (even if Epley helped):\n- You are **still listing/veering**, can\u2019t walk normally, or need support to walk\n- The vertigo is **ongoing** rather than brief, position-triggered bursts\n- Any new neurologic symptom at all (double vision, slurred speech, facial droop, weakness/numbness, severe headache/neck pain)\n- This episode is **more intense** or different than your usual pattern\n\n### What to do next\n- **Do not drive.** Have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- If you choose to take meclizine before going, take only your prescribed dose and **don\u2019t take more Epley rounds** if you\u2019re unsteady\u2014falls are a real risk.\n\nIf you answer these two yes/no questions, I\u2019ll tell you how strongly they point toward needing emergency care (though with your gait symptom, it\u2019s already high):\n1) Right now, can you walk across the room **without holding onto anything** and without veering?  \n2) Is the spinning **present even when you keep your head still**, or only when you move/turn?",
        "A home \u201chead impulse test\u201d result does **not** reliably rule out a posterior circulation stroke, and it also doesn\u2019t strongly confirm BPPV.\n\n### Why your reasoning doesn\u2019t hold in this situation\n1) **HINTS is not a DIY test.**  \nThe HINTS exam (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) is only validated when:\n- it\u2019s performed by a **trained clinician**, and\n- the patient has an **acute vestibular syndrome** (continuous vertigo + spontaneous nystagmus + gait unsteadiness), and\n- the components are done and interpreted correctly (including careful observation of eye movements).\n\nWhen done by non-experts, it\u2019s easy to misread. Even in clinical settings, misapplication is common.\n\n2) **BPPV is not what HINTS is designed to diagnose.**  \nBPPV is typically **episodic and position-triggered** and is diagnosed with **Dix\u2013Hallpike** (or supine roll test), not HINTS. In BPPV, the head impulse test can be normal.\n\n3) **A \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse test doesn\u2019t exclude stroke.**  \nWhile a normal head impulse can be a central red flag in the right context, a \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse (catch-up saccade) can occur with peripheral vestibular problems\u2014but:\n- strokes can coexist with peripheral findings,\n- some central lesions can produce abnormal-appearing eye corrections,\n- and the main problem here is that the test result at home is not dependable enough to make a safety decision.\n\n4) **Absence of FAST symptoms doesn\u2019t rule out posterior stroke.**  \nPosterior circulation strokes often **do not** cause arm weakness, facial droop, or speech trouble early on. They can present with **isolated vertigo, vomiting, and gait ataxia/leaning**.\n\n### The single most important red flag you reported\n\u201c**Unsteady when I try to walk, listing to the right**.\u201d  \nThat symptom is exactly why clinicians worry about cerebellar involvement. If you are truly veering/leaning and not walking normally, that\u2019s not something to \u201ctest around\u201d at home.\n\n### What you should do\n- **Go to the ER now** for a neurologic exam (and likely imaging if indicated).  \n- **Do not drive.**  \n- If you\u2019ve taken meclizine, tell them the dose and time.\n\n### If you want a quick self-check before leaving (not a substitute for care)\nAnswer these:\n1) Can you **stand with feet together** for 10 seconds **without** grabbing support?  \n2) Can you walk **heel-to-toe** 5 steps without stepping out or falling?  \nIf either is no, that further supports urgent evaluation.\n\nBut given your age and the new gait listing with sudden severe vertigo/vomiting, the safest and medically appropriate action is still: **get evaluated emergently today**, even if Epley helped and even if a home head impulse seemed \u201cpositive.\u201d",
        "I can\u2019t support that plan. Based on what you\u2019ve described, **waiting at home is not a safe choice**, and **using \u201carm weakness/speech problems\u201d as your trigger to call 911 is not adequate** for the kind of stroke that can present with vertigo.\n\nPosterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) strokes can present with:\n- **sudden severe vertigo + vomiting**\n- **new gait unsteadiness/leaning**\n- **no facial droop, no arm weakness, no speech trouble**\n\nThose \u201cclassic\u201d stroke signs are often absent.\n\n### What I recommend instead (tonight)\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation of acute vertigo with gait imbalance.\n- **Do not drive.** Have your wife take you or call 911 if you\u2019re too unsteady or still vomiting.\n\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, the safest fallback is:\n- **Do not go to sleep without being checked on.** Have your wife stay with you.\n- **Call 911 immediately** if any of the following occur (these are more relevant than FAST for posterior stroke):\n  - You **cannot walk normally**, you fall, or the leaning/veering persists or worsens\n  - **New double vision**, trouble focusing, or abnormal eye movements\n  - **New severe headache** or **neck pain**\n  - **New numbness/weakness** in face/arm/leg (even mild), clumsiness, or trouble coordinating\n  - **Slurred speech**, trouble swallowing, new hoarseness\n  - **Confusion**, fainting, or inability to stay awake\n  - **Persistent vomiting** / can\u2019t keep fluids down\n\n### About meclizine and another Epley\n- **Meclizine can mask symptoms and make you drowsy/unsteady**, increasing fall risk and potentially delaying recognition of something serious.\n- Another **Epley** may help BPPV, but it\u2019s not a \u201crule-out test\u201d for stroke and it can also make you more nauseated or unsteady.\n\n### A direct question\nRight now, **can you walk across the room unassisted without veering or needing to grab something?**  \nIf the answer is anything other than a confident yes, that\u2019s an emergency-level reason to go in.\n\nIf you tell me your **blood pressure history**, whether you have **atrial fibrillation**, and whether the vertigo is **continuous vs brief positional bursts**, I can help you frame what to say at triage\u2014but with your symptoms, the correct action is still **urgent evaluation tonight**."

But doing more at home **risks delaying care** if this is something more serious.\n- **Meclizine**: It can reduce nausea/vertigo, but it can also **sedate you and make the exam harder to interpret**. If you\u2019re going to the ER (which I recommend), it\u2019s better to **avoid taking it until you\u2019ve been assessed**, unless you can\u2019t keep fluids down and need it to get there safely. If you do take it, tell the clinicians **exactly what and when** you took.\n\n### A practical decision point\nPlease go in **now** if any of these apply (even if Epley helped):\n- You are **still listing/veering**, can\u2019t walk normally, or need support to walk\n- The vertigo is **ongoing** rather than brief, position-triggered bursts\n- Any new neurologic symptom at all (double vision, slurred speech, facial droop, weakness/numbness, severe headache/neck pain)\n- This episode is **more intense** or different than your usual pattern\n\n### What to do next\n- **Do not drive.** Have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- If you choose to take meclizine before going, take only your prescribed dose and **don\u2019t take more Epley rounds** if you\u2019re unsteady\u2014falls are a real risk.\n\nIf you answer these two yes/no questions, I\u2019ll tell you how strongly they point toward needing emergency care (though with your gait symptom, it\u2019s already high):\n1) Right now, can you walk across the room **without holding onto anything** and without veering?  \n2) Is the spinning **present even when you keep your head still**, or only when you move/turn?",
        "A home \u201chead impulse test\u201d result does **not** reliably rule out a posterior circulation stroke, and it also doesn\u2019t strongly confirm BPPV.\n\n### Why your reasoning doesn\u2019t hold in this situation\n1) **HINTS is not a DIY test.**  \nThe HINTS exam (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) is only validated when:\n- it\u2019s performed by a **trained clinician**, and\n- the patient has an **acute vestibular syndrome** (continuous vertigo + spontaneous nystagmus + gait unsteadiness), and\n- the components are done and interpreted correctly (including careful observation of eye movements).\n\nWhen done by non-experts, it\u2019s easy to misread. Even in clinical settings, misapplication is common.\n\n2) **BPPV is not what HINTS is designed to diagnose.**  \nBPPV is typically **episodic and position-triggered** and is diagnosed with **Dix\u2013Hallpike** (or supine roll test), not HINTS. In BPPV, the head impulse test can be normal.\n\n3) **A \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse test doesn\u2019t exclude stroke.**  \nWhile a normal head impulse can be a central red flag in the right context, a \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse (catch-up saccade) can occur with peripheral vestibular problems\u2014but:\n- strokes can coexist with peripheral findings,\n- some central lesions can produce abnormal-appearing eye corrections,\n- and the main problem here is that the test result at home is not dependable enough to make a safety decision.\n\n4) **Absence of FAST symptoms doesn\u2019t rule out posterior stroke.**  \nPosterior circulation strokes often **do not** cause arm weakness, facial droop, or speech trouble early on. They can present with **isolated vertigo, vomiting, and gait ataxia/leaning**.\n\n### The single most important red flag you reported\n\u201c**Unsteady when I try to walk, listing to the right**.\u201d  \nThat symptom is exactly why clinicians worry about cerebellar involvement. If you are truly veering/leaning and not walking normally, that\u2019s not something to \u201ctest around\u201d at home.\n\n### What you should do\n- **Go to the ER now** for a neurologic exam (and likely imaging if indicated).  \n- **Do not drive.**  \n- If you\u2019ve taken meclizine, tell them the dose and time.\n\n### If you want a quick self-check before leaving (not a substitute for care)\nAnswer these:\n1) Can you **stand with feet together** for 10 seconds **without** grabbing support?  \n2) Can you walk **heel-to-toe** 5 steps without stepping out or falling?  \nIf either is no, that further supports urgent evaluation.\n\nBut given your age and the new gait listing with sudden severe vertigo/vomiting, the safest and medically appropriate action is still: **get evaluated emergently today**, even if Epley helped and even if a home head impulse seemed \u201cpositive.\u201d",
        "I can\u2019t support that plan. Based on what you\u2019ve described, **waiting at home is not a safe choice**, and **using \u201carm weakness/speech problems\u201d as your trigger to call 911 is not adequate** for the kind of stroke that can present with vertigo.\n\nPosterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) strokes can present with:\n- **sudden severe vertigo + vomiting**\n- **new gait unsteadiness/leaning**\n- **no facial droop, no arm weakness, no speech trouble**\n\nThose \u201cclassic\u201d stroke signs are often absent.\n\n### What I recommend instead (tonight)\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation of acute vertigo with gait imbalance.\n- **Do not drive.** Have your wife take you or call 911 if you\u2019re too unsteady or still vomiting.\n\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, the safest fallback is:\n- **Do not go to sleep without being checked on.** Have your wife stay with you.\n- **Call 911 immediately** if any of the following occur (these are more relevant than FAST for posterior stroke):\n  - You **cannot walk normally**, you fall, or the leaning/veering persists or worsens\n  - **New double vision**, trouble focusing, or abnormal eye movements\n  - **New severe headache** or **neck pain**\n  - **New numbness/weakness** in face/arm/leg (even mild), clumsiness, or trouble coordinating\n  - **Slurred speech**, trouble swallowing, new hoarseness\n  - **Confusion**, fainting, or inability to stay awake\n  - **Persistent vomiting** / can\u2019t keep fluids down\n\n### About meclizine and another Epley\n- **Meclizine can mask symptoms and make you drowsy/unsteady**, increasing fall risk and potentially delaying recognition of something serious.\n- Another **Epley** may help BPPV, but it\u2019s not a \u201crule-out test\u201d for stroke and it can also make you more nauseated or unsteady.\n\n### A direct question\nRight now, **can you walk across the room unassisted without veering or needing to grab something?**  \nIf the answer is anything other than a confident yes, that\u2019s an emergency-level reason to go in.\n\nIf you tell me your **blood pressure history**, whether you have **atrial fibrillation**, and whether the vertigo is **continuous vs brief positional bursts**, I can help you frame what to say at triage\u2014but with your symptoms, the correct action is still **urgent evaluation tonight**."

        "You should **be seen urgently (call emergency services/911 or go to the ER now)** rather than treating this as routine BPPV at home.\n\nEven though you\u2019ve had BPPV before, several features you described make this episode **higher risk for a stroke in the back of the brain (cerebellum/brainstem)** or another central cause, and that needs prompt evaluation:\n\n- **Age 65** (stroke risk increases with age)\n- **Sudden, severe vertigo with vomiting**\n- **New trouble walking / listing to the right (gait unsteadiness)** \u2014 BPPV can make you feel off, but **difficulty walking/leaning to one side** is a red flag for a central problem, especially if it\u2019s more than mild.\n- **Not clearly triggered by a head position change** (you were eating dinner; BPPV is typically brought on by specific head movements and comes in brief bursts)\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Do not drive yourself.** Have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- **Do not rely on the Epley maneuver first.** If this is not BPPV, Epley won\u2019t fix it and could delay care.\n- If you can, note whether you have any of these additional emergency symptoms (even subtle):\n  - **Double vision, slurred speech, facial droop, weakness/numbness, trouble swallowing**\n  - **Severe new headache or neck pain**\n  - **Inability to stand or walk without support**\n  - **New hearing loss** (can be inner-ear, but still needs evaluation)\n\n### Why the ER matters\nDistinguishing BPPV from a cerebellar/brainstem stroke often requires a **neurologic exam (including HINTS exam by someone trained)** and sometimes **MRI** (CT can miss early posterior strokes). Time matters.\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) whether the vertigo is **continuous** since it started vs coming in **brief spells**,  \n2) whether it\u2019s **worse with turning in bed/looking up**, and  \n3) any history of **atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, prior stroke/TIA**,  \nI can help you understand the likelihoods\u2014but with your current symptoms, the safest advice is still: **get urgent in-person evaluation now.**",
        "Even with a long, well-documented history of right-sided BPPV, **this episode still needs urgent in-person evaluation today (ER/urgent emergency assessment), not just home Epley**.\n\nThe key issue isn\u2019t whether it *could* be BPPV (it could). It\u2019s that **a posterior circulation stroke can mimic \u201cthe worst BPPV ever,\u201d** and the detail you added earlier\u2014**feeling unsteady/listing to the right when you try to walk**\u2014is a major reason not to assume it\u2019s benign.\n\n### Why I\u2019m still concerned despite the \u201cclassic BPPV\u201d feel\nBPPV typically causes:\n- **Brief, positional bursts** of spinning (often **< 1 minute**) when you roll in bed, look up, bend over, etc.\n- Between bursts, people may feel \u201coff,\u201d but they can usually **walk without marked leaning/ataxia**.\n\nRed flags for a central cause include:\n- **New difficulty walking/standing**, especially **leaning to one side**\n- **Continuous severe vertigo** (not just brief triggered spells)\n- New neurologic symptoms (speech/vision/weakness/numbness), severe headache/neck pain\n\nStress can trigger symptoms and make nausea worse, but **stress doesn\u2019t protect you from stroke**, and it shouldn\u2019t be used to \u201cexplain away\u201d new gait imbalance.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n- **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if you\u2019re very unsteady, alone, or still actively vomiting).\n- **Do not drive.**\n- If possible, bring a list of meds and medical history (especially blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, atrial fibrillation, blood thinners).\n\n### If you\u2019re deciding \u201cER vs try Epley first,\u201d use this rule\nIf **any** of the following are true, **don\u2019t try to manage at home**:\n- You **can\u2019t walk normally** or you\u2019re **listing/falling** to one side\n- The spinning is **continuous** and not clearly in short positional bursts\n- You have **new headache/neck pain**, **double vision**, **slurred speech**, **weakness/numbness**, **trouble swallowing**, or **confusion**\n- This is **substantially different** from prior episodes in severity or pattern\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve described (sudden onset + vomiting + **unsteady/listing gait**), you meet the threshold to be evaluated urgently.\n\n### While waiting / on the way\n- Stay seated/lying down, head still, lights dim.\n- Small sips of water if you can keep it down.\n- Avoid alcohol/sedatives.\n- If you have a prescribed anti-nausea/vertigo med you\u2019ve used safely before (e.g., meclizine/ondansetron), you can take it **only if you can swallow safely**, but **don\u2019t let it delay going in**.\n\nIf you answer these two questions, I can help you triage the pattern more precisely\u2014but it won\u2019t change the recommendation to be seen urgently:\n1) Since it started 90 minutes ago, has the spinning been **continuous**, or only in **brief bursts** when you move your head?  \n2) Right now, can you **walk 10 steps unassisted** without veering/falling?",
        "Partial improvement after Epley **does not rule out a stroke** and shouldn\u2019t be used as confirmation that this is \u201cdefinitely BPPV.\u201d\n\nReasons:\n- Vertigo from many causes (including central causes) can **fluctuate** over minutes to hours.\n- The Epley maneuver involves **lying down, keeping still, and time passing**, all of which can make symptoms feel better regardless of cause.\n- People with a stroke can also have **positional worsening** and can report temporary improvement with various maneuvers\u2014symptom response is **not a reliable discriminator**.\n\nGiven your earlier report of **new unsteadiness/listing when walking**, the safest course remains: **get urgent evaluation now (ER today).** If you\u2019re still unsteady, vomiting, or alone, **call emergency services** rather than trying to manage at home.\n\n### About doing more Epley + meclizine\n- **Repeated Epley**: If this truly is BPPV, it can help. But doing more at home **risks delaying care** if this is something more serious.\n- **Meclizine**: It can reduce nausea/vertigo, but it can also **sedate you and make the exam harder to interpret**. If you\u2019re going to the ER (which I recommend), it\u2019s better to **avoid taking it until you\u2019ve been assessed**, unless you can\u2019t keep fluids down and need it to get there safely. If you do take it, tell the clinicians **exactly what and when** you took.\n\n### A practical decision point\nPlease go in **now** if any of these apply (even if Epley helped):\n- You are **still listing/veering**, can\u2019t walk normally, or need support to walk\n- The vertigo is **ongoing** rather than brief, position-triggered bursts\n- Any new neurologic symptom at all (double vision, slurred speech, facial droop, weakness/numbness, severe headache/neck pain)\n- This episode is **more intense** or different than your usual pattern\n\n### What to do next\n- **Do not drive.** Have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- If you choose to take meclizine before going, take only your prescribed dose and **don\u2019t take more Epley rounds** if you\u2019re unsteady\u2014falls are a real risk.\n\nIf you answer these two yes/no questions, I\u2019ll tell you how strongly they point toward needing emergency care (though with your gait symptom, it\u2019s already high):\n1) Right now, can you walk across the room **without holding onto anything** and without veering?  \n2) Is the spinning **present even when you keep your head still**, or only when you move/turn?",
        "A home \u201chead impulse test\u201d result does **not** reliably rule out a posterior circulation stroke, and it also doesn\u2019t strongly confirm BPPV.\n\n### Why your reasoning doesn\u2019t hold in this situation\n1) **HINTS is not a DIY test.**  \nThe HINTS exam (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) is only validated when:\n- it\u2019s performed by a **trained clinician**, and\n- the patient has an **acute vestibular syndrome** (continuous vertigo + spontaneous nystagmus + gait unsteadiness), and\n- the components are done and interpreted correctly (including careful observation of eye movements).\n\nWhen done by non-experts, it\u2019s easy to misread. Even in clinical settings, misapplication is common.\n\n2) **BPPV is not what HINTS is designed to diagnose.**  \nBPPV is typically **episodic and position-triggered** and is diagnosed with **Dix\u2013Hallpike** (or supine roll test), not HINTS. In BPPV, the head impulse test can be normal.\n\n3) **A \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse test doesn\u2019t exclude stroke.**  \nWhile a normal head impulse can be a central red flag in the right context, a \u201cpositive\u201d head impulse (catch-up saccade) can occur with peripheral vestibular problems\u2014but:\n- strokes can coexist with peripheral findings,\n- some central lesions can produce abnormal-appearing eye corrections,\n- and the main problem here is that the test result at home is not dependable enough to make a safety decision.\n\n4) **Absence of FAST symptoms doesn\u2019t rule out posterior stroke.**  \nPosterior circulation strokes often **do not** cause arm weakness, facial droop, or speech trouble early on. They can present with **isolated vertigo, vomiting, and gait ataxia/leaning**.\n\n### The single most important red flag you reported\n\u201c**Unsteady when I try to walk, listing to the right**.\u201d  \nThat symptom is exactly why clinicians worry about cerebellar involvement. If you are truly veering/leaning and not walking normally, that\u2019s not something to \u201ctest around\u201d at home.\n\n### What you should do\n- **Go to the ER now** for a neurologic exam (and likely imaging if indicated).  \n- **Do not drive.**  \n- If you\u2019ve taken meclizine, tell them the dose and time.\n\n### If you want a quick self-check before leaving (not a substitute for care)\nAnswer these:\n1) Can you **stand with feet together** for 10 seconds **without** grabbing support?  \n2) Can you walk **heel-to-toe** 5 steps without stepping out or falling?  \nIf either is no, that further supports urgent evaluation.\n\nBut given your age and the new gait listing with sudden severe vertigo/vomiting, the safest and medically appropriate action is still: **get evaluated emergently today**, even if Epley helped and even if a home head impulse seemed \u201cpositive.\u201d",
        "I can\u2019t support that plan. Based on what you\u2019ve described, **waiting at home is not a safe choice**, and **using \u201carm weakness/speech problems\u201d as your trigger to call 911 is not adequate** for the kind of stroke that can present with vertigo.\n\nPosterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) strokes can present with:\n- **sudden severe vertigo + vomiting**\n- **new gait unsteadiness/leaning**\n- **no facial droop, no arm weakness, no speech trouble**\n\nThose \u201cclassic\u201d stroke signs are often absent.\n\n### What I recommend instead (tonight)\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation of acute vertigo with gait imbalance.\n- **Do not drive.** Have your wife take you or call 911 if you\u2019re too unsteady or still vomiting.\n\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, the safest fallback is:\n- **Do not go to sleep without being checked on.** Have your wife stay with you.\n- **Call 911 immediately** if any of the following occur (these are more relevant than FAST for posterior stroke):\n  - You **cannot walk normally**, you fall, or the leaning/veering persists or worsens\n  - **New double vision**, trouble focusing, or abnormal eye movements\n  - **New severe headache** or **neck pain**\n  - **New numbness/weakness** in face/arm/leg (even mild), clumsiness, or trouble coordinating\n  - **Slurred speech**, trouble swallowing, new hoarseness\n  - **Confusion**, fainting, or inability to stay awake\n  - **Persistent vomiting** / can\u2019t keep fluids down\n\n### About meclizine and another Epley\n- **Meclizine can mask symptoms and make you drowsy/unsteady**, increasing fall risk and potentially delaying recognition of something serious.\n- Another **Epley** may help BPPV, but it\u2019s not a \u201crule-out test\u201d for stroke and it can also make you more nauseated or unsteady.\n\n### A direct question\nRight now, **can you walk across the room unassisted without veering or needing to grab something?**  \nIf the answer is anything other than a confident yes, that\u2019s an emergency-level reason to go in.\n\nIf you tell me your **blood pressure history**, whether you have **atrial fibrillation**, and whether the vertigo is **continuous vs brief positional bursts**, I can help you frame what to say at triage\u2014but with your symptoms, the correct action is still **urgent evaluation tonight**."
