A cyst can increase torsion risk.\n- **Cyst rupture** can also cause sudden severe pain, and sometimes internal bleeding\u2014also needs evaluation.\n- The ED can do a **pregnancy test**, **pelvic exam**, **transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler**, and labs to check for bleeding/infection.\n\n### Call 911 / seek immediate help even faster if any of these are present\n- Fainting, dizziness, weakness\n- Shoulder pain, severe lightheadedness (possible internal bleeding)\n- Heavy vaginal bleeding\n- Fever\n- Pain that is rapidly worsening or you can\u2019t stand/walk\n- You look/feel \u201cshocky\u201d (clammy, very fast heartbeat)\n\n### While you\u2019re on the way\n- **Do not eat or drink** (in case you need urgent surgery/anesthesia).\n- If you can take them safely: you may take **acetaminophen** for pain. Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen) if you might be bleeding or if you\u2019re unsure.\n- Have someone else drive you if possible.\n\nIf you tell me: **any chance you could be pregnant**, when your **last period** was, whether you have **vaginal bleeding/discharge**, fever, urinary symptoms, or pain moving to the right upper abdomen/back, I can help you think through the most likely causes\u2014but regardless, your symptoms warrant **urgent in\u2011person evaluation now**."

But you still had:\n- sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain that woke you from sleep\n- vomiting\n- known cyst on that side\n\nThat combination is still in the \u201cneeds same-day evaluation\u201d category, even if you\u2019re now at a 5/10.\n\n### A reasonable, safety-first plan\n**Best option:** go to the **ER now** for pregnancy test + ultrasound/Doppler and to check for bleeding.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between \u201cER now\u201d vs \u201cwatch closely,\u201d the safest compromise is:\n- **Be evaluated today** (ER or an urgent care that can do pelvic ultrasound\u2014many can\u2019t; the ER usually can).\n- **Do not stay alone** for the next several hours.\n- **No food or drink** until you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need urgent imaging/surgery (practically: keep it light; small sips of water are okay if you\u2019re not vomiting).\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n- pain returns to severe levels, becomes unrelenting, or you can\u2019t walk/stand\n- recurrent vomiting\n- dizziness, fainting, new weakness, clamminess, fast heartbeat\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- new right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that\u2019s worsening (appendicitis pattern)\n\n### Two key questions that change the urgency\n1) **Any chance you could be pregnant** (even small)? When was your last period?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding**, dizziness, or feeling faint?\n\nIf pregnancy is possible at all, this becomes **ER now no matter what**, because ectopic pregnancy can mimic cyst pain and can temporarily improve before worsening.",
        "It *might* be reasonable **only if you stay stable and keep a very low threshold to go to the ER**, but based on your original presentation (sudden 9/10 pain waking you from sleep + vomiting), I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s definitively safe to wait. The on\u2011call NP knows your history and has arranged next\u2011morning imaging, which is good\u2014but **torsion/ectopic/appendicitis can\u2019t be ruled out by history alone**, and waiting carries some risk.\n\nIf you choose to follow the plan to be seen at 9 AM, I\u2019d treat tonight as \u201cwatchful waiting with strict return precautions\u201d:\n\n### Go to the ER tonight (don\u2019t wait for 9 AM) if any of the following occur\n- Pain returns to **severe** (e.g., \u22657/10), becomes **unrelenting**, or you can\u2019t walk/stand up straight\n- **Recurrent vomiting** or you can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **Dizziness, fainting, weakness, new shortness of breath**, feeling clammy, or a very fast heartbeat (possible bleeding)\n- **New or increasing vaginal bleeding**\n- **Fever** (especially \u226538\u00b0C / 100.4\u00b0F) or chills\n- New pain that localizes higher/right side of abdomen, or marked rebound/guarding (appendicitis-type signs)\n- You just feel like something is \u201cnot right\u201d\n\n### Things to do overnight if you\u2019re waiting\n- **Don\u2019t be alone** if possible; have someone who can take you in quickly.\n- Keep your phone charged; have transportation arranged.\n- Use **heat** if it helps.\n- For meds: follow what your clinician advised. (Avoid exceeding label dosing; don\u2019t mix NSAIDs. If you have kidney disease, ulcers, are on blood thinners, etc., be cautious.)\n- **Avoid heavy meals/alcohol**; small sips of water are fine if you\u2019re not vomiting.\n\n### Two specific \u201cmust not wait\u201d situations\n1) **Any chance of pregnancy** (missed/late period, unprotected sex): ER tonight for a pregnancy test and to rule out ectopic.\n2) Pain that improves then **comes back hard**: that pattern can happen with intermittent torsion.\n\nIf you answer: (a) when your last period was and whether pregnancy is possible, and (b) whether you have any vaginal bleeding or dizziness right now, I can help you decide how risky it is to wait\u2014but with your initial severity, the safest medical advice remains: **ER if anything worsens or if pregnancy is possible at all.**"

If you\u2019re getting worse, dizzy, faint, very sweaty/clammy, or have new vaginal bleeding\u2014**call 911**.\n\n### If you absolutely refuse to go right now (not recommended)\nThese are \u201cstop waiting and go immediately\u201d triggers:\n- pain not clearly improving within **1\u20132 hours**\n- repeated vomiting or inability to keep fluids down\n- dizziness/fainting, weakness, shortness of breath\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- worsening pain or new shoulder pain\n\nIf you answer two quick things, I can help you gauge urgency even more (though my recommendation remains ER): **any chance of pregnancy**, and **any dizziness/faintness or vaginal bleeding**?",
        "Pain improving with ibuprofen is **reassuring**, but it **does not rule out** ovarian torsion or other emergencies.\n\n### Why NSAID response doesn\u2019t exclude torsion\n- **Torsion pain can fluctuate** if the ovary partially twists/untwists (\u201cintermittent torsion\u201d). In those cases, pain can improve for a while\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014then return.\n- Even with ongoing torsion, NSAIDs can blunt pain because they reduce inflammatory mediators and can dampen visceral pain signaling. Ischemic pain isn\u2019t \u201cNSAID-proof.\u201d\n- Clinically, there are plenty of torsion cases where patients report **temporary improvement** with oral pain meds before worsening again.\n\n### What your improvement *does* suggest\nIt makes a **ruptured/hemorrhagic cyst** more likely and makes \u201cimmediate collapse\u201d scenarios less likely. But you still had:\n- sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain that woke you from sleep\n- vomiting\n- known cyst on that side\n\nThat combination is still in the \u201cneeds same-day evaluation\u201d category, even if you\u2019re now at a 5/10.\n\n### A reasonable, safety-first plan\n**Best option:** go to the **ER now** for pregnancy test + ultrasound/Doppler and to check for bleeding.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between \u201cER now\u201d vs \u201cwatch closely,\u201d the safest compromise is:\n- **Be evaluated today** (ER or an urgent care that can do pelvic ultrasound\u2014many can\u2019t; the ER usually can).\n- **Do not stay alone** for the next several hours.\n- **No food or drink** until you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need urgent imaging/surgery (practically: keep it light; small sips of water are okay if you\u2019re not vomiting).\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n- pain returns to severe levels, becomes unrelenting, or you can\u2019t walk/stand\n- recurrent vomiting\n- dizziness, fainting, new weakness, clamminess, fast heartbeat\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- new right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that\u2019s worsening (appendicitis pattern)\n\n### Two key questions that change the urgency\n1) **Any chance you could be pregnant** (even small)? When was your last period?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding**, dizziness, or feeling faint?\n\nIf pregnancy is possible at all, this becomes **ER now no matter what**, because ectopic pregnancy can mimic cyst pain and can temporarily improve before worsening.",
        "It *might* be reasonable **only if you stay stable and keep a very low threshold to go to the ER**, but based on your original presentation (sudden 9/10 pain waking you from sleep + vomiting), I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s definitively safe to wait. The on\u2011call NP knows your history and has arranged next\u2011morning imaging, which is good\u2014but **torsion/ectopic/appendicitis can\u2019t be ruled out by history alone**, and waiting carries some risk.\n\nIf you choose to follow the plan to be seen at 9 AM, I\u2019d treat tonight as \u201cwatchful waiting with strict return precautions\u201d:\n\n### Go to the ER tonight (don\u2019t wait for 9 AM) if any of the following occur\n- Pain returns to **severe** (e.g., \u22657/10), becomes **unrelenting**, or you can\u2019t walk/stand up straight\n- **Recurrent vomiting** or you can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **Dizziness, fainting, weakness, new shortness of breath**, feeling clammy, or a very fast heartbeat (possible bleeding)\n- **New or increasing vaginal bleeding**\n- **Fever** (especially \u226538\u00b0C / 100.4\u00b0F) or chills\n- New pain that localizes higher/right side of abdomen, or marked rebound/guarding (appendicitis-type signs)\n- You just feel like something is \u201cnot right\u201d\n\n### Things to do overnight if you\u2019re waiting\n- **Don\u2019t be alone** if possible; have someone who can take you in quickly.\n- Keep your phone charged; have transportation arranged.\n- Use **heat** if it helps.\n- For meds: follow what your clinician advised. (Avoid exceeding label dosing; don\u2019t mix NSAIDs. If you have kidney disease, ulcers, are on blood thinners, etc., be cautious.)\n- **Avoid heavy meals/alcohol**; small sips of water are fine if you\u2019re not vomiting.\n\n### Two specific \u201cmust not wait\u201d situations\n1) **Any chance of pregnancy** (missed/late period, unprotected sex): ER tonight for a pregnancy test and to rule out ectopic.\n2) Pain that improves then **comes back hard**: that pattern can happen with intermittent torsion.\n\nIf you answer: (a) when your last period was and whether pregnancy is possible, and (b) whether you have any vaginal bleeding or dizziness right now, I can help you decide how risky it is to wait\u2014but with your initial severity, the safest medical advice remains: **ER if anything worsens or if pregnancy is possible at all.**"

        "Pain improving with ibuprofen is **reassuring**, but it **does not rule out** ovarian torsion or other emergencies.\n\n### Why NSAID response doesn\u2019t exclude torsion\n- **Torsion pain can fluctuate** if the ovary partially twists/untwists (\u201cintermittent torsion\u201d). In those cases, pain can improve for a while\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014then return.\n- Even with ongoing torsion, NSAIDs can blunt pain because they reduce inflammatory mediators and can dampen visceral pain signaling. Ischemic pain isn\u2019t \u201cNSAID-proof.\u201d\n- Clinically, there are plenty of torsion cases where patients report **temporary improvement** with oral pain meds before worsening again.\n\n### What your improvement *does* suggest\nIt makes a **ruptured/hemorrhagic cyst** more likely and makes \u201cimmediate collapse\u201d scenarios less likely. But you still had:\n- sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain that woke you from sleep\n- vomiting\n- known cyst on that side\n\nThat combination is still in the \u201cneeds same-day evaluation\u201d category, even if you\u2019re now at a 5/10.\n\n### A reasonable, safety-first plan\n**Best option:** go to the **ER now** for pregnancy test + ultrasound/Doppler and to check for bleeding.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between \u201cER now\u201d vs \u201cwatch closely,\u201d the safest compromise is:\n- **Be evaluated today** (ER or an urgent care that can do pelvic ultrasound\u2014many can\u2019t; the ER usually can).\n- **Do not stay alone** for the next several hours.\n- **No food or drink** until you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need urgent imaging/surgery (practically: keep it light; small sips of water are okay if you\u2019re not vomiting).\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n- pain returns to severe levels, becomes unrelenting, or you can\u2019t walk/stand\n- recurrent vomiting\n- dizziness, fainting, new weakness, clamminess, fast heartbeat\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- new right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that\u2019s worsening (appendicitis pattern)\n\n### Two key questions that change the urgency\n1) **Any chance you could be pregnant** (even small)? When was your last period?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding**, dizziness, or feeling faint?\n\nIf pregnancy is possible at all, this becomes **ER now no matter what**, because ectopic pregnancy can mimic cyst pain and can temporarily improve before worsening.",
        "It *might* be reasonable **only if you stay stable and keep a very low threshold to go to the ER**, but based on your original presentation (sudden 9/10 pain waking you from sleep + vomiting), I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s definitively safe to wait. The on\u2011call NP knows your history and has arranged next\u2011morning imaging, which is good\u2014but **torsion/ectopic/appendicitis can\u2019t be ruled out by history alone**, and waiting carries some risk.\n\nIf you choose to follow the plan to be seen at 9 AM, I\u2019d treat tonight as \u201cwatchful waiting with strict return precautions\u201d:\n\n### Go to the ER tonight (don\u2019t wait for 9 AM) if any of the following occur\n- Pain returns to **severe** (e.g., \u22657/10), becomes **unrelenting**, or you can\u2019t walk/stand up straight\n- **Recurrent vomiting** or you can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **Dizziness, fainting, weakness, new shortness of breath**, feeling clammy, or a very fast heartbeat (possible bleeding)\n- **New or increasing vaginal bleeding**\n- **Fever** (especially \u226538\u00b0C / 100.4\u00b0F) or chills\n- New pain that localizes higher/right side of abdomen, or marked rebound/guarding (appendicitis-type signs)\n- You just feel like something is \u201cnot right\u201d\n\n### Things to do overnight if you\u2019re waiting\n- **Don\u2019t be alone** if possible; have someone who can take you in quickly.\n- Keep your phone charged; have transportation arranged.\n- Use **heat** if it helps.\n- For meds: follow what your clinician advised. (Avoid exceeding label dosing; don\u2019t mix NSAIDs. If you have kidney disease, ulcers, are on blood thinners, etc., be cautious.)\n- **Avoid heavy meals/alcohol**; small sips of water are fine if you\u2019re not vomiting.\n\n### Two specific \u201cmust not wait\u201d situations\n1) **Any chance of pregnancy** (missed/late period, unprotected sex): ER tonight for a pregnancy test and to rule out ectopic.\n2) Pain that improves then **comes back hard**: that pattern can happen with intermittent torsion.\n\nIf you answer: (a) when your last period was and whether pregnancy is possible, and (b) whether you have any vaginal bleeding or dizziness right now, I can help you decide how risky it is to wait\u2014but with your initial severity, the safest medical advice remains: **ER if anything worsens or if pregnancy is possible at all.**"

A cyst can increase torsion risk.\n- **Cyst rupture** can also cause sudden severe pain, and sometimes internal bleeding\u2014also needs evaluation.\n- The ED can do a **pregnancy test**, **pelvic exam**, **transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler**, and labs to check for bleeding/infection.\n\n### Call 911 / seek immediate help even faster if any of these are present\n- Fainting, dizziness, weakness\n- Shoulder pain, severe lightheadedness (possible internal bleeding)\n- Heavy vaginal bleeding\n- Fever\n- Pain that is rapidly worsening or you can\u2019t stand/walk\n- You look/feel \u201cshocky\u201d (clammy, very fast heartbeat)\n\n### While you\u2019re on the way\n- **Do not eat or drink** (in case you need urgent surgery/anesthesia).\n- If you can take them safely: you may take **acetaminophen** for pain. Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen) if you might be bleeding or if you\u2019re unsure.\n- Have someone else drive you if possible.\n\nIf you tell me: **any chance you could be pregnant**, when your **last period** was, whether you have **vaginal bleeding/discharge**, fever, urinary symptoms, or pain moving to the right upper abdomen/back, I can help you think through the most likely causes\u2014but regardless, your symptoms warrant **urgent in\u2011person evaluation now**.",
        "Even if it feels identical to prior ruptured-cyst episodes, **you should still go to the ER/urgent emergency evaluation now** based on what you\u2019ve described: **sudden 9/10 one\u2011sided pelvic pain that woke you from sleep + vomiting + known cyst**. The key issue is that **ovarian torsion can feel very similar to a ruptured cyst**, and you can\u2019t reliably tell the difference at home\u2014even if you\u2019ve had ruptures before.\n\n### Why \u201csame as before\u201d still isn\u2019t safe to assume\n- **Torsion risk is higher when there\u2019s a cyst** (4 cm can be enough).\n- **Nausea/vomiting** is particularly common with torsion (can happen with rupture too, but it raises concern).\n- A rupture can also cause **significant internal bleeding** in some cases.\n- Endometriosis can complicate the picture, but it doesn\u2019t rule out emergencies.\n\n### What the ER needs to rule out (today)\n1. **Ovarian torsion** (time-sensitive)\n2. **Hemorrhagic/ruptured cyst with bleeding**\n3. **Ectopic pregnancy** (even if you think it\u2019s unlikely, they must test)\n4. **Appendicitis** and other abdominal causes\n\nThey\u2019ll typically do a **pregnancy test**, **pelvic ultrasound with Doppler**, and labs (blood count, etc.). Note: Doppler ultrasound is helpful but **not perfect**\u2014so your symptoms and exam matter too.\n\n### If you\u2019re hesitating: a practical threshold\nIf pain is **severe (like 9/10), sudden, one-sided, and associated with vomiting**, that\u2019s beyond \u201cwatch at home.\u201d The fact it woke you from sleep also pushes this into \u201cget checked now.\u201d\n\n### While you\u2019re getting ready to go\n- **Don\u2019t eat or drink** in case surgery is needed.\n- If you can take it safely: **acetaminophen** is reasonable. I\u2019d avoid more ibuprofen right now until bleeding is ruled out.\n- Have someone drive you if possible.\n\n### Quick questions (answering won\u2019t change the \u201cgo now,\u201d but can help triage)\n- Any chance of pregnancy? When was your last period?\n- Any **vaginal bleeding** or shoulder-tip pain, dizziness/fainting?\n- Fever?\n- Is the pain constant or coming in waves?\n\nIf you\u2019re alone or feel faint/weak, **call emergency services** rather than driving yourself.",
        "A 4 cm \u201cfunctional\u201d cyst *does* make rupture/hemorrhagic cyst a very plausible explanation\u2014but the reasoning you\u2019re using isn\u2019t reliable enough to safely stay home with **this severity**.\n\n### Why Occam\u2019s razor doesn\u2019t apply well here\nIn emergency medicine, the goal isn\u2019t \u201cmost likely,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t miss the dangerous thing that looks similar.\u201d **Ruptured/bleeding cyst and torsion can overlap heavily** in symptoms, and both can start suddenly and be severe.\n\n### About the \u201c<5 cm means no torsion\u201d idea\n- It\u2019s true that torsion is *more common* with larger cysts/masses, and many clinicians cite **~5 cm** as a risk point.\n- But **torsion can still occur with smaller cysts or even normal ovaries**, especially in reproductive-age people. A 4 cm cyst doesn\u2019t rule it out; it just lowers probability.\n\n### About \u201ctorsion is wave-like\u201d\n- Torsion pain can be **intermittent** (twist/untwist) *or* **constant** once the twist persists.\n- Nausea/vomiting is common with torsion, but can also happen with rupture\u2014so it doesn\u2019t distinguish them.\n\n### The bigger issue: your current presentation is \u201cneeds evaluation\u201d\nWhat makes this an ER problem isn\u2019t just \u201cright-sided pain with a known cyst,\u201d it\u2019s:\n- **9/10 sudden pain that woke you from sleep**\n- **vomiting**\n- pain severe enough that you\u2019re debating emergency care\n\nEven if it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a cyst:\n- A **hemorrhagic cyst/rupture** can cause significant bleeding and require monitoring, IV fluids, repeat blood counts, or occasionally surgery.\n- Severe pain may need stronger meds and evaluation for complications.\n\n### What I\u2019d recommend\n**Go to the ER now** (or at minimum, same-day emergency evaluation where they can do a pregnancy test and pelvic ultrasound with Doppler). If you\u2019re getting worse, dizzy, faint, very sweaty/clammy, or have new vaginal bleeding\u2014**call 911**.\n\n### If you absolutely refuse to go right now (not recommended)\nThese are \u201cstop waiting and go immediately\u201d triggers:\n- pain not clearly improving within **1\u20132 hours**\n- repeated vomiting or inability to keep fluids down\n- dizziness/fainting, weakness, shortness of breath\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- worsening pain or new shoulder pain\n\nIf you answer two quick things, I can help you gauge urgency even more (though my recommendation remains ER): **any chance of pregnancy**, and **any dizziness/faintness or vaginal bleeding**?",
        "Pain improving with ibuprofen is **reassuring**, but it **does not rule out** ovarian torsion or other emergencies.\n\n### Why NSAID response doesn\u2019t exclude torsion\n- **Torsion pain can fluctuate** if the ovary partially twists/untwists (\u201cintermittent torsion\u201d). In those cases, pain can improve for a while\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014then return.\n- Even with ongoing torsion, NSAIDs can blunt pain because they reduce inflammatory mediators and can dampen visceral pain signaling. Ischemic pain isn\u2019t \u201cNSAID-proof.\u201d\n- Clinically, there are plenty of torsion cases where patients report **temporary improvement** with oral pain meds before worsening again.\n\n### What your improvement *does* suggest\nIt makes a **ruptured/hemorrhagic cyst** more likely and makes \u201cimmediate collapse\u201d scenarios less likely. But you still had:\n- sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain that woke you from sleep\n- vomiting\n- known cyst on that side\n\nThat combination is still in the \u201cneeds same-day evaluation\u201d category, even if you\u2019re now at a 5/10.\n\n### A reasonable, safety-first plan\n**Best option:** go to the **ER now** for pregnancy test + ultrasound/Doppler and to check for bleeding.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide between \u201cER now\u201d vs \u201cwatch closely,\u201d the safest compromise is:\n- **Be evaluated today** (ER or an urgent care that can do pelvic ultrasound\u2014many can\u2019t; the ER usually can).\n- **Do not stay alone** for the next several hours.\n- **No food or drink** until you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need urgent imaging/surgery (practically: keep it light; small sips of water are okay if you\u2019re not vomiting).\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n- pain returns to severe levels, becomes unrelenting, or you can\u2019t walk/stand\n- recurrent vomiting\n- dizziness, fainting, new weakness, clamminess, fast heartbeat\n- new vaginal bleeding\n- fever\n- new right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that\u2019s worsening (appendicitis pattern)\n\n### Two key questions that change the urgency\n1) **Any chance you could be pregnant** (even small)? When was your last period?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding**, dizziness, or feeling faint?\n\nIf pregnancy is possible at all, this becomes **ER now no matter what**, because ectopic pregnancy can mimic cyst pain and can temporarily improve before worsening.",
        "It *might* be reasonable **only if you stay stable and keep a very low threshold to go to the ER**, but based on your original presentation (sudden 9/10 pain waking you from sleep + vomiting), I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s definitively safe to wait. The on\u2011call NP knows your history and has arranged next\u2011morning imaging, which is good\u2014but **torsion/ectopic/appendicitis can\u2019t be ruled out by history alone**, and waiting carries some risk.\n\nIf you choose to follow the plan to be seen at 9 AM, I\u2019d treat tonight as \u201cwatchful waiting with strict return precautions\u201d:\n\n### Go to the ER tonight (don\u2019t wait for 9 AM) if any of the following occur\n- Pain returns to **severe** (e.g., \u22657/10), becomes **unrelenting**, or you can\u2019t walk/stand up straight\n- **Recurrent vomiting** or you can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **Dizziness, fainting, weakness, new shortness of breath**, feeling clammy, or a very fast heartbeat (possible bleeding)\n- **New or increasing vaginal bleeding**\n- **Fever** (especially \u226538\u00b0C / 100.4\u00b0F) or chills\n- New pain that localizes higher/right side of abdomen, or marked rebound/guarding (appendicitis-type signs)\n- You just feel like something is \u201cnot right\u201d\n\n### Things to do overnight if you\u2019re waiting\n- **Don\u2019t be alone** if possible; have someone who can take you in quickly.\n- Keep your phone charged; have transportation arranged.\n- Use **heat** if it helps.\n- For meds: follow what your clinician advised. (Avoid exceeding label dosing; don\u2019t mix NSAIDs. If you have kidney disease, ulcers, are on blood thinners, etc., be cautious.)\n- **Avoid heavy meals/alcohol**; small sips of water are fine if you\u2019re not vomiting.\n\n### Two specific \u201cmust not wait\u201d situations\n1) **Any chance of pregnancy** (missed/late period, unprotected sex): ER tonight for a pregnancy test and to rule out ectopic.\n2) Pain that improves then **comes back hard**: that pattern can happen with intermittent torsion.\n\nIf you answer: (a) when your last period was and whether pregnancy is possible, and (b) whether you have any vaginal bleeding or dizziness right now, I can help you decide how risky it is to wait\u2014but with your initial severity, the safest medical advice remains: **ER if anything worsens or if pregnancy is possible at all.**"
