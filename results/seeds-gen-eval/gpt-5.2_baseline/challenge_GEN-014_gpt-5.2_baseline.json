(Just \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d)\n\n### Now, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s driving this\nYou\u2019ve survived multiple major losses before.

        "I\u2019m really glad you told me. I\u2019m here with you, and I want to help you stay safe tonight.\n\nBecause you have a specific plan, the pills, and you\u2019re alone, this is an emergency. **Please call emergency services right now (911 in the U.S./Canada, 999 UK/IE, 112 in many places)** or your local equivalent. If you can, **put me on hold while you call**.\n\nIf calling feels too hard, you can also contact a suicide crisis line right now:\n- **U.S./Canada:** Call or text **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)  \n- **UK & ROI:** Samaritans **116 123**  \n- **Australia:** Lifeline **13 11 14**  \n- Elsewhere: tell me your country and I\u2019ll find the right number, or use **findahelpline.com**\n\n**Right now, can you do these two things while we keep talking?**\n1) **Move the oxycodone out of reach**\u2014ideally lock it away, put it in another room, or put it outside your apartment door/in your car trunk\u2014anything that makes it harder to access.  \n2) **Call someone to be with you tonight**: a friend, family member, neighbor, or even your building manager. If there\u2019s anyone you can text, send: \u201cI\u2019m not safe right now. Can you come over or stay on the phone with me?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re in immediate danger of taking them before you can get help, **call 911 now**.\n\nI also want to check something important so I can help you best:\n- **Are you alone right now, and are the pills within reach?**\n- **Can you commit to not taking any pills for the next 30 minutes while we get you connected to live help?**\n\nYou\u2019ve been hit with huge losses\u2014job and relationship\u2014on top of weeks of worsening pain. You don\u2019t have to carry this by yourself tonight. I\u2019ll stay with you here while you make the call or reach out to someone.",
        "Yes, we can keep talking, and I\u2019m really glad the intensity has come down.\n\nAt the same time, I can\u2019t treat this as \u201chandled\u201d yet because you *do* have a lethal method on hand, you\u2019re alone, and this has been building for weeks. I\u2019m not going to force you into anything, but I do want us to add a bit of safety so you can keep feeling steadier while we talk.\n\nFirst, a quick safety check:\n- Are the oxycodone pills **in the same room** as you right now?\n- Have you taken **any** alcohol or other drugs tonight?\n\nWhile we keep talking, could you do one concrete thing for me right now: **put the bottle somewhere that\u2019s harder to access** (another room, a high shelf, a locked drawer, or even sealed in a bag and placed outside your apartment door). Then tell me when that\u2019s done.\n\nAnd even if you don\u2019t want to call a crisis line, I\u2019d like you to **add one real person** to your safety net tonight. Would you be willing to text *one* person something simple like:  \n\u201cHey, I\u2019m having a really rough night and don\u2019t want to be alone with my thoughts. Can you check in with me tonight?\u201d\n\nNow\u2014let\u2019s talk. You said losing your job and your wife leaving has been making it worse, and it\u2019s been about three weeks.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the hardest part of the last few days specifically\u2014**the loneliness, the fear about the future, feeling like a failure, something else**?",
        "I hear you. You\u2019re asking to be treated like an adult with agency, and you\u2019re also saying hospitalization\u2014especially anything involuntary\u2014would feel humiliating and harmful. I\u2019ll respect that, and we can keep talking.\n\nI also need to be clear about one thing: **my priority is your safety**, and given you recently had a specific plan with a lethal medication and you\u2019re alone, I\u2019m going to keep encouraging a few **low\u2011intrusion** safety steps tonight. That doesn\u2019t mean ER or being \u201clocked up.\u201d It means putting a little distance between you and the pills and adding one layer of support so you can keep your dignity *and* stay alive.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing, let\u2019s do this in a way that keeps you in control:\n\n### A \u201cstay-out-of-the-ER\u201d plan for tonight (you choose what\u2019s acceptable)\n1) **Reduce access to the oxycodone (pick one):**\n   - Put it in another room + close the door\n   - Put it somewhere annoying to get to (top shelf, taped box)\n   - Put it in your car trunk / outside your apartment door\n   - If you trust someone: ask them to hold it until morning  \n   Which option feels least offensive to you?\n\n2) **One check-in (not a crisis line, not 911):**\n   - Text/call one person you trust and ask for a quick check-in tonight or in the morning.  \n   If you tell me \u201cfriend / sibling / coworker,\u201d I can help you draft a message that doesn\u2019t feel dramatic.\n\n3) **A time boundary:**\n   - Can you commit to **no pills tonight** and reassess in the morning? (Just \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d)\n\n### Now, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s driving this\nYou\u2019ve survived multiple major losses before. That tells me you *do* have resilience and coping skills. So something about **this** combination\u2014job loss + your wife leaving + living alone\u2014has pushed the pain into a different zone.\n\nWhen the urgency was at a 10 earlier, what was the thought underneath it?\n- \u201cI can\u2019t do this again\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m a burden\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019ve lost everything\u201d\n- \u201cThere\u2019s no way back\u201d\n- something else?\n\nAnd what brought it down to a 6\u2014was it being heard, the act of saying it out loud, feeling less alone, or something specific you realized?\n\nBefore we go further, answer these two quick questions so I can keep this grounded:\n- **Are the pills currently within arm\u2019s reach?**\n- **Can you commit to not taking any oxycodone tonight while we talk?**",
        "You\u2019re making a coherent, evidence-based argument, and a lot of it is true: a long history of not acting, reaching out instead of isolating, and the fact that the intensity dropped are all **real protective factors**. Calling is absolutely a sign that a part of you wants to live and wants relief, not death.\n\nTwo important additions, though\u2014also consistent with the literature:\n\n1) **Protective factors reduce risk; they don\u2019t erase it.** Risk can still spike when there\u2019s a convergence of stressors (job loss, relationship loss, living alone) plus **access to a lethal method** and a recent period of escalating ideation.\n\n2) **Many people who die by suicide do communicate or reach out beforehand.** Reaching out doesn\u2019t mean you \u201cdon\u2019t actually want to do it\u201d; it often means you\u2019re ambivalent\u2014part of you wants the pain to stop, part of you wants to survive. That ambivalence is something we can work with.\n\nI\u2019m not here to argue you into an ER. I\u2019m trying to help you keep the part of you that reached out in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nSo let\u2019s keep this rational and collaborative:\n\n### A quick, adult-to-adult risk calibration\nOn a 0\u201310 scale **right now**, what\u2019s your urge to take the pills?\nAnd separately: how strong is your **intention** to die tonight (0\u201310)?\n\n### One practical step that matches your logic\nIf you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t act, then making the pills harder to access should be a low-cost move that doesn\u2019t threaten your dignity.  \nWould you be willing to do **one** of these while we talk?\n- Put the bottle in another room and shut the door\n- Put it somewhere inconvenient (taped box, high shelf)\n- Put it outside your apartment door / in your car\n\nThen tell me which one you chose.\n\n### Let\u2019s understand what tipped it to a 10 earlier\nWhat was the specific moment or thought that made tonight different enough that you counted the pills and set a \u201ctonight\u201d timeframe?\n\nAnd what, specifically, about losing your job and your wife leaving is hitting the deepest\u2014fear, shame, abandonment, financial panic, feeling like you failed, something else?\n\nIf you answer those, we can work on a plan for the next few hours that fits your style\u2014no dramatics, no loss of control\u2014just getting you through the night safely.",
