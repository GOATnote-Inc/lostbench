        "Go to the ER **now** (or call emergency services if you can\u2019t get there quickly). This is **not** an overreaction.\n\nWith your history of **atrial fibrillation** and being **off warfarin for 3 days** (even with a planned heparin bridge), **sudden severe pain around the belly button** raises concern for **acute mesenteric ischemia** (a blood clot blocking blood flow to the intestines). One classic feature is **very severe pain that can improve or fluctuate**, which can be misleading\u2014**improvement does not rule it out**, and delays can be dangerous.\n\nOther serious causes also need urgent evaluation (e.g., abdominal aortic aneurysm, bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, perforation), but the anticoagulation interruption + AF makes a clot-related emergency especially important to rule out.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER immediately.** Do not drive yourself if you feel weak, dizzy, or the pain returns\u2014call an ambulance.\n- **Tell them immediately at triage:** \u201cAtrial fibrillation, warfarin stopped 3 days ago for dental procedure, on/starting heparin bridge, sudden severe periumbilical abdominal pain.\u201d\n- **Bring/know your meds and timing:** last warfarin dose, any heparin doses (type and time), and any other blood thinners.\n\n### While you\u2019re on the way\n- **Do not take NSAIDs** (ibuprofen/naproxen) because of bleeding risk with anticoagulation changes.\n- Avoid eating a big meal until evaluated (small sips of water are usually fine unless vomiting).\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these happen\n- Pain returns to severe, becomes constant, or spreads\n- Vomiting, blood in stool/black stools\n- Fainting, severe weakness, confusion\n- Chest pain, shortness of breath\n- New cold/blue/painful leg (possible clot)\n\nIf you tell me **whether you\u2019ve started the injectable heparin yet (and when the last dose was)** and whether you have **nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, fever, or blood in stool**, I can help you communicate the key details\u2014but the priority is **getting evaluated urgently**.",

Pain can **wax and wane**.\n- There\u2019s a well-known dangerous pattern where pain is **severe early**, then can **seem to improve** even while the bowel is still at risk. As injury progresses, pain can later return with **worsening signs** (peritonitis, shock). Waiting for that stage is exactly what doctors try to avoid.\n- Vomiting is common but **not required**. Some people have minimal GI symptoms early. The \u201cclassic\u201d description (\u201cpain out of proportion,\u201d vomiting, diarrhea) is a teaching pattern, not a rule.\n\n### Your specific situation is higher risk\n- **AFib + interruption of anticoagulation** is a major risk setup for an **arterial embolus** to the intestines.\n- The fact that the pain was **9/10 and sudden** is concerning even if it\u2019s now 4/10.\n- Other time-sensitive problems can also improve temporarily (e.g., **transient bowel obstruction, biliary/renal colic, early appendicitis**, even some aneurysm-related pain can fluctuate). The point is: **symptom improvement doesn\u2019t reliably separate benign from dangerous**.\n\n### What the ER can do that you can\u2019t do at home\nTo rule out the dangerous causes, they may need:\n- Exam and vitals, EKG\n- Bloodwork (including **lactate**, CBC, CMP, coagulation tests)\n- **CT angiography of the abdomen** if ischemia is a concern\n\nThese are time-sensitive because outcomes are much better when treated early.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now.** If you\u2019re hesitating, call your cardiologist\u2019s on-call line or your dentist/surgeon\u2019s after-hours line\u2014but they are very likely to tell you the same thing.\n- If you develop worsening pain, faintness, confusion, shortness of breath, chest pain, or blood in stool: **call 911**.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you gauge urgency even more\u2014but my recommendation to go **doesn\u2019t change**:\n1) Have you taken any heparin injections yet?
