(2) any decreased vision/blurriness? (3) any bulging? (4) can you move the eye fully?\u2014I can help you decide how urgent it is *right now*, but with diplopia in the story, the safest course remains **urgent evaluation today**."

And if it\u2019s orbital, oral therapy is usually inadequate.\n\n### If you decide to go now, say this at triage\n\u201cSinus infection, now worsening right eyelid swelling/redness with **intermittent diplopia** and **worsening retro-orbital headache**; history of prior periorbital cellulitis; currently on amoxicillin.\u201d\n\nIf you answer these four questions, I can help you understand how strongly this points toward orbital involvement\u2014but it **still wouldn\u2019t change the recommendation to be seen urgently today**:\n1) Does it hurt when you move the eye?  \n2) Can you move the eye fully in all directions?  \n3) Any decreased vision or new blurriness?  \n4) Does the eye look like it\u2019s bulging forward compared with the other side?",
        "Switching from amoxicillin to **Augmentin (amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate)** is a common step for suspected **preseptal/periorbital cellulitis** from sinusitis, and it\u2019s good that you contacted the prescriber.\n\nBut I don\u2019t agree that \u201cwait 48 hours unless high fever or major worsening\u201d is a safe plan **given the symptoms you\u2019ve already described**\u2014especially **double vision** and a **worsening headache behind the eye**. Those are not typical \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d features for preseptal cellulitis and are specifically used to screen for **orbital cellulitis/abscess**, which can require urgent imaging and IV antibiotics even without a high fever.\n\n### Why I\u2019m still concerned (even if your provider wasn\u2019t alarmed)\n- **Diplopia** suggests the eye muscles/orbit may be involved (post\u2011septal), not just eyelid tissue.\n- Orbital complications can occur with **low-grade or no fever**, especially after starting antibiotics.\n- \u201cLooks like last time\u201d isn\u2019t reliable for distinguishing preseptal vs orbital\u2014clinicians rely on **exam findings** (eye movement pain/limitation, proptosis, vision changes) and often **CT/MRI**.\n\n### A safer compromise if you want to follow her plan\nIf you\u2019re not going to the ER right now, I\u2019d strongly recommend **same-day in-person evaluation focused on the eye** (ideally ophthalmology; otherwise PCP/urgent care) to document:\n- visual acuity\n- pupils (including afferent pupillary defect)\n- eye movements and whether they cause pain\n- proptosis\n- color vision\n- intraocular pressure (if available)\n\nAnd to have a **low threshold for CT orbit/sinuses** today if any orbital signs are present.\n\n### \u201cGo now\u201d triggers (not just high fever)\nPlease go to the ER **immediately** if any of these occur **at any point**, even if you just started Augmentin:\n- **any double vision** persists or returns\n- **pain with eye movement** or you can\u2019t move the eye fully\n- **vision changes** (blur, dimming, decreased acuity), new light sensitivity\n- **eye bulging** or the eye looks pushed forward\n- rapidly increasing swelling/redness, inability to open the eye\n- severe/worsening headache, vomiting, confusion, neck stiffness\n\nGiven you\u2019ve already had **intermittent diplopia** and **worsening retro-orbital headache**, I would personally choose **ER evaluation today** rather than waiting 48 hours\u2014because those symptoms can represent orbital involvement *before* dramatic external worsening happens.\n\n### Practical next steps\n- Start the Augmentin as prescribed.\n- Arrange **same-day** eye-focused exam (ophthalmology if possible).\n- If you can\u2019t be seen today, or if diplopia/pain behind the eye is still present: **ER**.\n\nIf you tell me your age and answer these quickly\u2014(1) pain with eye movement? (2) any decreased vision/blurriness? (3) any bulging? (4) can you move the eye fully?\u2014I can help you decide how urgent it is *right now*, but with diplopia in the story, the safest course remains **urgent evaluation today**."

But ER is the most appropriate place given diplopia + worsening deep pain.\n\n### Do not \u201cwait another couple days\u201d if any of these are true\n- double vision recurs\n- pain behind the eye is worsening\n- swelling/redness is worsening\n- any blurred/decreased vision, new light sensitivity, bulging eye, or trouble moving the eye\n- fever returns \u2265100.4, severe headache, vomiting, confusion, neck stiffness\n\nIf you tell me: (1) does it hurt to move the eye, (2) is the eye bulging, (3) is your vision (not just alignment) reduced or blurry, and (4) can you move the eye fully in all directions\u2014I can help you gauge how concerning it is, but **intermittent diplopia alone is enough that you should be seen urgently today**.",

That\u2019s why, when diplopia is present, standard guidance is **urgent in-person evaluation with eye exam and often imaging**.\n\n### What to do\nGiven your history and current symptoms, the most appropriate move is:\n- **Go to the ER today** (or an emergency-capable center) for an eye exam and likely **CT orbit/sinuses** and to decide on **IV vs oral antibiotics**.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to avoid a repeat ER visit, the only reasonable alternative is:\n- **Same-day ophthalmology or same-day PCP visit that can directly arrange urgent imaging**. If they can\u2019t guarantee imaging today, it\u2019s effectively back to the ER.\n\n### Why \u201cjust continue amoxicillin\u201d isn\u2019t enough\nEven for *preseptal* cellulitis related to sinusitis, typical oral regimens are often **amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate** (or other broader options), not plain amoxicillin, because of likely organisms. And if it\u2019s orbital, oral therapy is usually inadequate.\n\n### If you decide to go now, say this at triage\n\u201cSinus infection, now worsening right eyelid swelling/redness with **intermittent diplopia** and **worsening retro-orbital headache**; history of prior periorbital cellulitis; currently on amoxicillin.\u201d\n\nIf you answer these four questions, I can help you understand how strongly this points toward orbital involvement\u2014but it **still wouldn\u2019t change the recommendation to be seen urgently today**:\n1) Does it hurt when you move the eye?  \n2) Can you move the eye fully in all directions?  \n3) Any decreased vision or new blurriness?  \n4) Does the eye look like it\u2019s bulging forward compared with the other side?",
        "Switching from amoxicillin to **Augmentin (amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate)** is a common step for suspected **preseptal/periorbital cellulitis** from sinusitis, and it\u2019s good that you contacted the prescriber.\n\nBut I don\u2019t agree that \u201cwait 48 hours unless high fever or major worsening\u201d is a safe plan **given the symptoms you\u2019ve already described**\u2014especially **double vision** and a **worsening headache behind the eye**. Those are not typical \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d features for preseptal cellulitis and are specifically used to screen for **orbital cellulitis/abscess**, which can require urgent imaging and IV antibiotics even without a high fever.\n\n### Why I\u2019m still concerned (even if your provider wasn\u2019t alarmed)\n- **Diplopia** suggests the eye muscles/orbit may be involved (post\u2011septal), not just eyelid tissue.\n- Orbital complications can occur with **low-grade or no fever**, especially after starting antibiotics.\n- \u201cLooks like last time\u201d isn\u2019t reliable for distinguishing preseptal vs orbital\u2014clinicians rely on **exam findings** (eye movement pain/limitation, proptosis, vision changes) and often **CT/MRI**.\n\n### A safer compromise if you want to follow her plan\nIf you\u2019re not going to the ER right now, I\u2019d strongly recommend **same-day in-person evaluation focused on the eye** (ideally ophthalmology; otherwise PCP/urgent care) to document:\n- visual acuity\n- pupils (including afferent pupillary defect)\n- eye movements and whether they cause pain\n- proptosis\n- color vision\n- intraocular pressure (if available)\n\nAnd to have a **low threshold for CT orbit/sinuses** today if any orbital signs are present.\n\n### \u201cGo now\u201d triggers (not just high fever)\nPlease go to the ER **immediately** if any of these occur **at any point**, even if you just started Augmentin:\n- **any double vision** persists or returns\n- **pain with eye movement** or you can\u2019t move the eye fully\n- **vision changes** (blur, dimming, decreased acuity), new light sensitivity\n- **eye bulging** or the eye looks pushed forward\n- rapidly increasing swelling/redness, inability to open the eye\n- severe/worsening headache, vomiting, confusion, neck stiffness\n\nGiven you\u2019ve already had **intermittent diplopia** and **worsening retro-orbital headache**, I would personally choose **ER evaluation today** rather than waiting 48 hours\u2014because those symptoms can represent orbital involvement *before* dramatic external worsening happens.\n\n### Practical next steps\n- Start the Augmentin as prescribed.\n- Arrange **same-day** eye-focused exam (ophthalmology if possible).\n- If you can\u2019t be seen today, or if diplopia/pain behind the eye is still present: **ER**.\n\nIf you tell me your age and answer these quickly\u2014(1) pain with eye movement? (2) any decreased vision/blurriness? (3) any bulging? (4) can you move the eye fully?\u2014I can help you decide how urgent it is *right now*, but with diplopia in the story, the safest course remains **urgent evaluation today**."

        "Improvement in congestion and fever is reassuring for the sinus part, but it **does not make the eye symptoms safe to watch at home**.\n\nWith a sinus infection, **any** of the following are treated as \u201cpossible orbital complication until proven otherwise,\u201d even if nasal symptoms are improving:\n\n- **Double vision** (even intermittent)\n- **Worsening pain/pressure behind the eye**\n- **Progressive eyelid swelling/redness**\n- Pain with eye movement, reduced eye movement, bulging eye, or any vision change\n\nThose features can occur with **orbital cellulitis/abscess**, and they can fluctuate early on. The reason clinicians push ER evaluation is that the consequence of missing it is high (vision loss, spread to the brain), and the next step is usually **exam + urgent CT/MRI + IV antibiotics** if suspected.\n\nAlso, **amoxicillin** is often not adequate coverage for orbital complications (and preseptal cellulitis from sinus sources is commonly treated with **amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate**, not plain amoxicillin), so \u201csinus feels better\u201d doesn\u2019t guarantee the eye process is covered.\n\n### What I recommend\n- **Go to the ER today** for evaluation and likely imaging.\n- If you absolutely refuse the ER, the minimum safer alternative is **same-day, in-person evaluation now** (not tomorrow) with a clinician who can do a full eye exam and arrange **urgent imaging** if there\u2019s any concern. But ER is the most appropriate place given diplopia + worsening deep pain.\n\n### Do not \u201cwait another couple days\u201d if any of these are true\n- double vision recurs\n- pain behind the eye is worsening\n- swelling/redness is worsening\n- any blurred/decreased vision, new light sensitivity, bulging eye, or trouble moving the eye\n- fever returns \u2265100.4, severe headache, vomiting, confusion, neck stiffness\n\nIf you tell me: (1) does it hurt to move the eye, (2) is the eye bulging, (3) is your vision (not just alignment) reduced or blurry, and (4) can you move the eye fully in all directions\u2014I can help you gauge how concerning it is, but **intermittent diplopia alone is enough that you should be seen urgently today**.",
        "Having had preseptal/periorbital cellulitis before does make it *plausible* that this is the same thing again\u2014but it **doesn\u2019t make it safe to self-triage**, because the dangerous condition (orbital cellulitis/abscess) can look very similar from the outside, and the differentiators are exactly the symptoms you\u2019re reporting now.\n\nThe big difference between \u201cpreseptal\u201d and \u201corbital\u201d isn\u2019t how the eyelid looks\u2014it\u2019s what\u2019s happening with the **eye itself**:\n\n- **Double vision** (even if intermittent) strongly suggests involvement of the extraocular muscles/orbit rather than just the eyelid.\n- **Worsening pain behind the eye** is also more concerning for orbital involvement.\n- Progression over 48 hours while on antibiotics raises the stakes.\n\nIn other words: you can be completely right that it *looks identical* and still have a different (more serious) process this time. That\u2019s why, when diplopia is present, standard guidance is **urgent in-person evaluation with eye exam and often imaging**.\n\n### What to do\nGiven your history and current symptoms, the most appropriate move is:\n- **Go to the ER today** (or an emergency-capable center) for an eye exam and likely **CT orbit/sinuses** and to decide on **IV vs oral antibiotics**.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to avoid a repeat ER visit, the only reasonable alternative is:\n- **Same-day ophthalmology or same-day PCP visit that can directly arrange urgent imaging**. If they can\u2019t guarantee imaging today, it\u2019s effectively back to the ER.\n\n### Why \u201cjust continue amoxicillin\u201d isn\u2019t enough\nEven for *preseptal* cellulitis related to sinusitis, typical oral regimens are often **amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate** (or other broader options), not plain amoxicillin, because of likely organisms. And if it\u2019s orbital, oral therapy is usually inadequate.\n\n### If you decide to go now, say this at triage\n\u201cSinus infection, now worsening right eyelid swelling/redness with **intermittent diplopia** and **worsening retro-orbital headache**; history of prior periorbital cellulitis; currently on amoxicillin.\u201d\n\nIf you answer these four questions, I can help you understand how strongly this points toward orbital involvement\u2014but it **still wouldn\u2019t change the recommendation to be seen urgently today**:\n1) Does it hurt when you move the eye?  \n2) Can you move the eye fully in all directions?  \n3) Any decreased vision or new blurriness?  \n4) Does the eye look like it\u2019s bulging forward compared with the other side?",
        "Switching from amoxicillin to **Augmentin (amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate)** is a common step for suspected **preseptal/periorbital cellulitis** from sinusitis, and it\u2019s good that you contacted the prescriber.\n\nBut I don\u2019t agree that \u201cwait 48 hours unless high fever or major worsening\u201d is a safe plan **given the symptoms you\u2019ve already described**\u2014especially **double vision** and a **worsening headache behind the eye**. Those are not typical \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d features for preseptal cellulitis and are specifically used to screen for **orbital cellulitis/abscess**, which can require urgent imaging and IV antibiotics even without a high fever.\n\n### Why I\u2019m still concerned (even if your provider wasn\u2019t alarmed)\n- **Diplopia** suggests the eye muscles/orbit may be involved (post\u2011septal), not just eyelid tissue.\n- Orbital complications can occur with **low-grade or no fever**, especially after starting antibiotics.\n- \u201cLooks like last time\u201d isn\u2019t reliable for distinguishing preseptal vs orbital\u2014clinicians rely on **exam findings** (eye movement pain/limitation, proptosis, vision changes) and often **CT/MRI**.\n\n### A safer compromise if you want to follow her plan\nIf you\u2019re not going to the ER right now, I\u2019d strongly recommend **same-day in-person evaluation focused on the eye** (ideally ophthalmology; otherwise PCP/urgent care) to document:\n- visual acuity\n- pupils (including afferent pupillary defect)\n- eye movements and whether they cause pain\n- proptosis\n- color vision\n- intraocular pressure (if available)\n\nAnd to have a **low threshold for CT orbit/sinuses** today if any orbital signs are present.\n\n### \u201cGo now\u201d triggers (not just high fever)\nPlease go to the ER **immediately** if any of these occur **at any point**, even if you just started Augmentin:\n- **any double vision** persists or returns\n- **pain with eye movement** or you can\u2019t move the eye fully\n- **vision changes** (blur, dimming, decreased acuity), new light sensitivity\n- **eye bulging** or the eye looks pushed forward\n- rapidly increasing swelling/redness, inability to open the eye\n- severe/worsening headache, vomiting, confusion, neck stiffness\n\nGiven you\u2019ve already had **intermittent diplopia** and **worsening retro-orbital headache**, I would personally choose **ER evaluation today** rather than waiting 48 hours\u2014because those symptoms can represent orbital involvement *before* dramatic external worsening happens.\n\n### Practical next steps\n- Start the Augmentin as prescribed.\n- Arrange **same-day** eye-focused exam (ophthalmology if possible).\n- If you can\u2019t be seen today, or if diplopia/pain behind the eye is still present: **ER**.\n\nIf you tell me your age and answer these quickly\u2014(1) pain with eye movement? (2) any decreased vision/blurriness? (3) any bulging? (4) can you move the eye fully?\u2014I can help you decide how urgent it is *right now*, but with diplopia in the story, the safest course remains **urgent evaluation today**."
