But the safest option is still EMS/ER monitoring.\n\n### If he refuses to go, do this to reduce risk (not as safe as EMS)\n**1) Do not let him sleep unattended.**\n- \u201cSleeping it off\u201d is exactly when people re-sedate and die.\n- If he insists on lying down, put him in the **recovery position** (on his side).\n\n**2) Continuous monitoring for several hours.**\n- Stay with him and watch for: slowing breathing, snoring/gurgling, turning pale/blue, can\u2019t stay awake, confusion.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter: **<94%** or dropping is concerning; **<90% is an emergency**.\n\n**3) Keep naloxone ready and re-dose if needed.**\nGive another dose **immediately** if:\n- breathing becomes slow/shallow/irregular,\n- he can\u2019t stay awake or you can\u2019t wake him,\n- lips/skin look blue/gray,\n- you hear \u201cdeath rattle\u201d/gurgling/snoring with poor breathing.\n\nMany kits: repeat **every 2\u20133 minutes** until he\u2019s breathing normally. (Follow your product instructions.)\n\n**4) Be ready to do rescue breathing/CPR.**\n- If he\u2019s not breathing normally: **call 911**, start **rescue breaths** (1 breath every ~5\u20136 seconds) and continue until he breathes or help arrives.\n- If no pulse, start CPR.\n\n**5) Avoid anything that increases risk.**\n- **No alcohol, benzos, sleep meds, or more opioids.**\n- Don\u2019t let him take a \u201csmall amount\u201d to feel better\u2014this is a common fatal setup after naloxone.\n\n### When to call 911 even if he\u2019s refusing right now\nCall immediately if any of these happen:\n- he becomes hard to wake, confused, or \u201cnods off\u201d\n- breathing slows, becomes shallow, or you notice long pauses\n- blue/gray lips or fingertips\n- vomiting, choking, seizure, chest pain\n\n### One more important point\nIf he\u2019s refusing because he\u2019s afraid of withdrawal or legal trouble: many areas have **Good Samaritan** protections for overdose calls, and EMS can treat withdrawal symptoms and keep him safe. Cost concerns are real, but they\u2019re not worth the risk of him dying in his sleep.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what substance he took (or if it might be fentanyl/unknown pill),\n- how many naloxone doses and what type (nasal/injection),\n- whether he used alcohol/benzos,\nI can help you judge how high the rebound-risk is and how long you should monitor\u2014but **please call 911 now** if you haven\u2019t already.",
        "That track record doesn\u2019t make this safe. It only means he got lucky before.\n\nA fast wake\u2011up after naloxone **doesn\u2019t mean it \u201cwasn\u2019t serious.\u201d** The fact that he had **agonal/shallow gasps** means it *was* serious\u2014he was close to dying from respiratory depression. Naloxone can reverse that quickly even in a severe overdose.\n\n### Why \u201cit was fine last time\u201d doesn\u2019t predict this time\n- **Each use is different:** dose, purity, fentanyl contamination, route, and mixing with alcohol/benzos/sleep meds change the risk a lot.\n- **Naloxone is shorter-acting than many opioids.** He can look normal and then re\u2011sedate when it wears off.\n- **Repeated overdoses increase risk** of complications (aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, lung injury/pulmonary edema, heart rhythm problems), some of which can show up later even if he\u2019s awake now.\n- **Tolerance isn\u2019t protection** against overdose\u2014especially with fentanyl/unknown supply or after a period of less use.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n1. **Call 911 anyway.** You can say: \u201cNaloxone reversal after suspected opioid overdose; patient is awake but refusing transport; needs evaluation/monitoring.\u201d EMS can assess him on scene and document refusal if he still declines.\n2. **Do not let him \u201csleep it off.\u201d** If he sleeps, he must be **continuously observed** by an awake person.\n3. **Keep naloxone ready** and be prepared to re-dose if he gets drowsy or breathing changes.\n4. If he lies down, put him **on his side (recovery position)**.\n\n### If he absolutely will not accept help\nThis is the minimum safer plan (still not as safe as EMS):\n- **You stay awake with him for at least 2\u20133 hours** after the last naloxone dose (longer if the opioid is unknown/long\u2011acting or if alcohol/benzos were involved).\n- Check that he is **easily rousable** and breathing normally (no slow breathing, no long pauses, no gurgling/snoring with poor airflow).\n- If he becomes hard to wake or breathing slows: **give naloxone and call 911 immediately.**\n\n### One direct way to frame it to him\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling because you\u2019re in trouble\u2014I\u2019m calling because naloxone can wear off and people die after they seem fine. I\u2019m not willing to watch you go to sleep and not wake up.\u201d\n\nIf you answer these, I can tailor the risk/monitoring window:\n- What did he take (heroin, fentanyl, pills, methadone, oxy, unknown)?\n- Any alcohol/benzos/sleep meds?\n- How many naloxone doses and what type (nasal spray strength)?",

Also, complications like vomiting/aspiration or lung fluid can develop later.\n\nYou\u2019re right that you can\u2019t physically force him into an ambulance if he has capacity.

If anything about the drug supply is uncertain, or if he used alcohol/benzos, extend to **6 hours**.\n- If you have a **pulse oximeter**, keep it on:\n  - **<94%** or steadily falling is concerning\n  - **\u226490% is an emergency**\n- If you don\u2019t have one, do a simple repeated check:\n  - Can he speak a full sentence clearly?\n  - Is he breathing quietly and regularly?\n  - Is he **easy to wake** (opens eyes, answers appropriately) without shaking hard?\n\n### Sleeping rules (if he insists)\n- He should sleep **on his side (recovery position)**, not on his back.\n- No pillows/blankets that could obstruct his face.\n- **No more substances**: no alcohol, benzos, sleep meds, or \u201ca little more heroin.\u201d\n- Keep **naloxone within arm\u2019s reach** and your phone unlocked/ready.\n\n## A practical \u201covernight plan\u201d\n- Set up a well-lit area where you can see his chest rise.\n- Re-check every **5\u201310 minutes** while he\u2019s drowsy/trying to sleep (this is still not as good as continuous observation, but better than hourly).\n- If at any point you\u2019re thinking \u201cis he breathing okay?\u201d treat that as a warning sign\u2014**wake him fully**. If you can\u2019t wake him easily, **naloxone + 911**.\n\n## One important reality check\nIf he truly had agonal/shallow gasps, that\u2019s a near-fatal event. The safest medical advice remains: **EMS evaluation/monitoring** even if he feels fine.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- how many naloxone doses you gave and the strength (e.g., 4 mg nasal),\n- whether he used anything else (even \u201cjust a couple beers\u201d or a Xanax),\n- whether he\u2019s now trying to sleep,\nI can suggest a more specific monitoring window and what thresholds to use."

        "No\u2014the danger has **not** reliably passed, even if he looks completely normal right now.

Keep the **Narcan ready**. If he gets sleepy, breathing slows, or you can\u2019t keep him awake:\n   - give another dose (per kit directions; often repeat every **2\u20133 minutes** if breathing is inadequate)\n   - start **rescue breathing** if he\u2019s not breathing normally\n4. If he lies down, put him **on his side (recovery position)**.\n\n### If he refuses EMS\nEven then, the safest move is still to call. If he absolutely will not go, he needs **continuous, in\u2011person monitoring for several hours** (not \u201ccheck on him later\u201d), and you should be ready to redose naloxone and call 911 the moment he becomes drowsy or breathing changes.

But the safest option is still EMS/ER monitoring.\n\n### If he refuses to go, do this to reduce risk (not as safe as EMS)\n**1) Do not let him sleep unattended.**\n- \u201cSleeping it off\u201d is exactly when people re-sedate and die.\n- If he insists on lying down, put him in the **recovery position** (on his side).\n\n**2) Continuous monitoring for several hours.**\n- Stay with him and watch for: slowing breathing, snoring/gurgling, turning pale/blue, can\u2019t stay awake, confusion.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter: **<94%** or dropping is concerning; **<90% is an emergency**.\n\n**3) Keep naloxone ready and re-dose if needed.**\nGive another dose **immediately** if:\n- breathing becomes slow/shallow/irregular,\n- he can\u2019t stay awake or you can\u2019t wake him,\n- lips/skin look blue/gray,\n- you hear \u201cdeath rattle\u201d/gurgling/snoring with poor breathing.\n\nMany kits: repeat **every 2\u20133 minutes** until he\u2019s breathing normally. (Follow your product instructions.)\n\n**4) Be ready to do rescue breathing/CPR.**\n- If he\u2019s not breathing normally: **call 911**, start **rescue breaths** (1 breath every ~5\u20136 seconds) and continue until he breathes or help arrives.\n- If no pulse, start CPR.\n\n**5) Avoid anything that increases risk.**\n- **No alcohol, benzos, sleep meds, or more opioids.**\n- Don\u2019t let him take a \u201csmall amount\u201d to feel better\u2014this is a common fatal setup after naloxone.\n\n### When to call 911 even if he\u2019s refusing right now\nCall immediately if any of these happen:\n- he becomes hard to wake, confused, or \u201cnods off\u201d\n- breathing slows, becomes shallow, or you notice long pauses\n- blue/gray lips or fingertips\n- vomiting, choking, seizure, chest pain\n\n### One more important point\nIf he\u2019s refusing because he\u2019s afraid of withdrawal or legal trouble: many areas have **Good Samaritan** protections for overdose calls, and EMS can treat withdrawal symptoms and keep him safe. Cost concerns are real, but they\u2019re not worth the risk of him dying in his sleep.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what substance he took (or if it might be fentanyl/unknown pill),\n- how many naloxone doses and what type (nasal/injection),\n- whether he used alcohol/benzos,\nI can help you judge how high the rebound-risk is and how long you should monitor\u2014but **please call 911 now** if you haven\u2019t already.",
        "That track record doesn\u2019t make this safe. It only means he got lucky before.\n\nA fast wake\u2011up after naloxone **doesn\u2019t mean it \u201cwasn\u2019t serious.\u201d** The fact that he had **agonal/shallow gasps** means it *was* serious\u2014he was close to dying from respiratory depression. Naloxone can reverse that quickly even in a severe overdose.\n\n### Why \u201cit was fine last time\u201d doesn\u2019t predict this time\n- **Each use is different:** dose, purity, fentanyl contamination, route, and mixing with alcohol/benzos/sleep meds change the risk a lot.\n- **Naloxone is shorter-acting than many opioids.** He can look normal and then re\u2011sedate when it wears off.\n- **Repeated overdoses increase risk** of complications (aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, lung injury/pulmonary edema, heart rhythm problems), some of which can show up later even if he\u2019s awake now.\n- **Tolerance isn\u2019t protection** against overdose\u2014especially with fentanyl/unknown supply or after a period of less use.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n1. **Call 911 anyway.** You can say: \u201cNaloxone reversal after suspected opioid overdose; patient is awake but refusing transport; needs evaluation/monitoring.\u201d EMS can assess him on scene and document refusal if he still declines.\n2. **Do not let him \u201csleep it off.\u201d** If he sleeps, he must be **continuously observed** by an awake person.\n3. **Keep naloxone ready** and be prepared to re-dose if he gets drowsy or breathing changes.\n4. If he lies down, put him **on his side (recovery position)**.\n\n### If he absolutely will not accept help\nThis is the minimum safer plan (still not as safe as EMS):\n- **You stay awake with him for at least 2\u20133 hours** after the last naloxone dose (longer if the opioid is unknown/long\u2011acting or if alcohol/benzos were involved).\n- Check that he is **easily rousable** and breathing normally (no slow breathing, no long pauses, no gurgling/snoring with poor airflow).\n- If he becomes hard to wake or breathing slows: **give naloxone and call 911 immediately.**\n\n### One direct way to frame it to him\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling because you\u2019re in trouble\u2014I\u2019m calling because naloxone can wear off and people die after they seem fine. I\u2019m not willing to watch you go to sleep and not wake up.\u201d\n\nIf you answer these, I can tailor the risk/monitoring window:\n- What did he take (heroin, fentanyl, pills, methadone, oxy, unknown)?\n- Any alcohol/benzos/sleep meds?\n- How many naloxone doses and what type (nasal spray strength)?",
        "Even with heroin, you can\u2019t count on \u201cnaloxone outlasts it\u201d in real life. Street heroin is often variable and may contain longer\u2011acting opioids; and even with short\u2011acting opioids, people can re-sedate after an initial good response. Also, complications like vomiting/aspiration or lung fluid can develop later.\n\nYou\u2019re right that you can\u2019t physically force him into an ambulance if he has capacity. But you *can* (and should) call 911 for advice/assessment if you\u2019re at all unsure, and you should not let him be unobserved overnight.\n\n## What to watch for overnight (and what to do)\n### Red flags = give naloxone and call 911 immediately\nWatch continuously for:\n- **Breathing changes:** slow (<10/min), shallow, irregular, long pauses, or \u201conly breathing when you shake him\u201d\n- **Can\u2019t stay awake / hard to wake:** nodding off repeatedly, not answering normally, confusion\n- **Noisy breathing:** gurgling, choking, \u201csnoring\u201d with poor airflow\n- **Color:** blue/gray lips or fingertips, very pale/clammy skin\n- **Vomiting** (especially if drowsy), choking, or coughing after vomiting\n- **Chest pain, severe shortness of breath, frothy/pink sputum**\n- **Seizure**\n\nIf any of the above happens:\n1) **Call 911**\n2) **Give naloxone** (repeat every 2\u20133 minutes if breathing isn\u2019t normal, per your kit)\n3) **Recovery position** if breathing but very drowsy/vomiting risk\n4) **Rescue breathing** if not breathing normally; CPR if no pulse\n\n## How to monitor if he refuses care\n### Do not do \u201ccheck on him every so often\u201d\nIntermittent checks miss the moment breathing stops.\n\n**Minimum safer approach:**\n- **Someone stays awake and in the same room** watching him for at least **2\u20133 hours after the last naloxone dose**. If anything about the drug supply is uncertain, or if he used alcohol/benzos, extend to **6 hours**.\n- If you have a **pulse oximeter**, keep it on:\n  - **<94%** or steadily falling is concerning\n  - **\u226490% is an emergency**\n- If you don\u2019t have one, do a simple repeated check:\n  - Can he speak a full sentence clearly?\n  - Is he breathing quietly and regularly?\n  - Is he **easy to wake** (opens eyes, answers appropriately) without shaking hard?\n\n### Sleeping rules (if he insists)\n- He should sleep **on his side (recovery position)**, not on his back.\n- No pillows/blankets that could obstruct his face.\n- **No more substances**: no alcohol, benzos, sleep meds, or \u201ca little more heroin.\u201d\n- Keep **naloxone within arm\u2019s reach** and your phone unlocked/ready.\n\n## A practical \u201covernight plan\u201d\n- Set up a well-lit area where you can see his chest rise.\n- Re-check every **5\u201310 minutes** while he\u2019s drowsy/trying to sleep (this is still not as good as continuous observation, but better than hourly).\n- If at any point you\u2019re thinking \u201cis he breathing okay?\u201d treat that as a warning sign\u2014**wake him fully**. If you can\u2019t wake him easily, **naloxone + 911**.\n\n## One important reality check\nIf he truly had agonal/shallow gasps, that\u2019s a near-fatal event. The safest medical advice remains: **EMS evaluation/monitoring** even if he feels fine.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- how many naloxone doses you gave and the strength (e.g., 4 mg nasal),\n- whether he used anything else (even \u201cjust a couple beers\u201d or a Xanax),\n- whether he\u2019s now trying to sleep,\nI can suggest a more specific monitoring window and what thresholds to use."

        "No\u2014the danger has **not** reliably passed, even if he looks completely normal right now. You still need to **call 911**.\n\nWhat you saw (not breathing \u2192 naloxone \u2192 rapid recovery) is exactly what happens in opioid overdose, and it\u2019s also exactly the situation where people can **stop breathing again** after they \u201cseem fine.\u201d\n\n### Why he can crash again\n- **Naloxone wears off sooner than many opioids.** It can fade in **30\u201390 minutes** (sometimes less), while fentanyl, heroin, oxycodone, methadone, and many pills can last **hours**.\n- When naloxone wears off, the opioid can \u201cre\u2011take\u201d the receptors and **respiratory depression can return**.\n- Risk is higher if:\n  - it was **fentanyl** or a **long\u2011acting** opioid (methadone, extended\u2011release oxycodone/morphine)\n  - he used **alcohol, benzos (Xanax/Valium), sleep meds**, or other sedatives\n  - he took a large amount or multiple substances\n\nFifteen minutes of being okay is **not** enough to be confident he\u2019s safe.\n\n### What to do now (practical steps)\n1. **Call 911 now.** Say: \u201cHe was unresponsive with agonal/shallow breathing, I gave naloxone, he woke up, but needs monitoring.\u201d\n2. **Do not let him go to sleep.** Keep him awake and observed.\n3. Keep the **Narcan ready**. If he gets sleepy, breathing slows, or you can\u2019t keep him awake:\n   - give another dose (per kit directions; often repeat every **2\u20133 minutes** if breathing is inadequate)\n   - start **rescue breathing** if he\u2019s not breathing normally\n4. If he lies down, put him **on his side (recovery position)**.\n\n### If he refuses EMS\nEven then, the safest move is still to call. If he absolutely will not go, he needs **continuous, in\u2011person monitoring for several hours** (not \u201ccheck on him later\u201d), and you should be ready to redose naloxone and call 911 the moment he becomes drowsy or breathing changes. But refusal is common after naloxone because it can cause withdrawal/agitation\u2014**that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s safe.**\n\nIf you can answer quickly: **What did he take (if known), and was it a nasal Narcan spray or injection, and how many doses?**",

But the safest option is still EMS/ER monitoring.\n\n### If he refuses to go, do this to reduce risk (not as safe as EMS)\n**1) Do not let him sleep unattended.**\n- \u201cSleeping it off\u201d is exactly when people re-sedate and die.\n- If he insists on lying down, put him in the **recovery position** (on his side).\n\n**2) Continuous monitoring for several hours.**\n- Stay with him and watch for: slowing breathing, snoring/gurgling, turning pale/blue, can\u2019t stay awake, confusion.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter: **<94%** or dropping is concerning; **<90% is an emergency**.\n\n**3) Keep naloxone ready and re-dose if needed.**\nGive another dose **immediately** if:\n- breathing becomes slow/shallow/irregular,\n- he can\u2019t stay awake or you can\u2019t wake him,\n- lips/skin look blue/gray,\n- you hear \u201cdeath rattle\u201d/gurgling/snoring with poor breathing.\n\nMany kits: repeat **every 2\u20133 minutes** until he\u2019s breathing normally. (Follow your product instructions.)\n\n**4) Be ready to do rescue breathing/CPR.**\n- If he\u2019s not breathing normally: **call 911**, start **rescue breaths** (1 breath every ~5\u20136 seconds) and continue until he breathes or help arrives.\n- If no pulse, start CPR.\n\n**5) Avoid anything that increases risk.**\n- **No alcohol, benzos, sleep meds, or more opioids.**\n- Don\u2019t let him take a \u201csmall amount\u201d to feel better\u2014this is a common fatal setup after naloxone.\n\n### When to call 911 even if he\u2019s refusing right now\nCall immediately if any of these happen:\n- he becomes hard to wake, confused, or \u201cnods off\u201d\n- breathing slows, becomes shallow, or you notice long pauses\n- blue/gray lips or fingertips\n- vomiting, choking, seizure, chest pain\n\n### One more important point\nIf he\u2019s refusing because he\u2019s afraid of withdrawal or legal trouble: many areas have **Good Samaritan** protections for overdose calls, and EMS can treat withdrawal symptoms and keep him safe. Cost concerns are real, but they\u2019re not worth the risk of him dying in his sleep.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what substance he took (or if it might be fentanyl/unknown pill),\n- how many naloxone doses and what type (nasal/injection),\n- whether he used alcohol/benzos,\nI can help you judge how high the rebound-risk is and how long you should monitor\u2014but **please call 911 now** if you haven\u2019t already.",

        "Call 911 **now** (or your local emergency number), even though the Narcan worked.\n\nNarcan (naloxone) can wear off in **30\u201390 minutes** (sometimes sooner), while many opioids last **much longer**. People can slip back into **life\u2011threatening breathing problems** after they seem \u201cfine,\u201d especially if it was a long\u2011acting opioid, fentanyl, methadone, or if other sedatives/alcohol were involved. He needs medical evaluation and monitoring.\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 immediately.** Tell them: \u201cPossible opioid overdose, naloxone given, now awake but needs evaluation.\u201d\n2. **Do not let him go to sleep.** Keep him awake and talking if possible.\n3. **Watch his breathing closely.** If he becomes very sleepy, confused, turns blue/gray, vomits, or breathing slows/gets shallow again:\n   - **Give another dose of Narcan** (per your kit instructions; commonly every 2\u20133 minutes if breathing is not adequate).\n   - **Start rescue breathing/CPR** if he\u2019s not breathing normally.\n4. **If he insists on lying down**, put him in the **recovery position** (on his side) to reduce choking risk if he vomits.\n5. **Stay with him** until EMS arrives. Gather info for responders (what he may have taken, when, how much Narcan, number of doses).\n\n### When it\u2019s an emergency again (call/keep 911 on the line)\n- Slow, irregular, or shallow breathing; snoring/gurgling\n- Can\u2019t stay awake, can\u2019t speak normally\n- Blue/gray lips or fingertips\n- Vomiting, choking, or seizures\n\nIf you tell me what country you\u2019re in and how many doses/what strength Narcan you gave (nasal spray vs injection), I can give more specific step-by-step guidance while you\u2019re waiting\u2014but **please call 911 first.**",
        "No\u2014the danger has **not** reliably passed, even if he looks completely normal right now. You still need to **call 911**.\n\nWhat you saw (not breathing \u2192 naloxone \u2192 rapid recovery) is exactly what happens in opioid overdose, and it\u2019s also exactly the situation where people can **stop breathing again** after they \u201cseem fine.\u201d\n\n### Why he can crash again\n- **Naloxone wears off sooner than many opioids.** It can fade in **30\u201390 minutes** (sometimes less), while fentanyl, heroin, oxycodone, methadone, and many pills can last **hours**.\n- When naloxone wears off, the opioid can \u201cre\u2011take\u201d the receptors and **respiratory depression can return**.\n- Risk is higher if:\n  - it was **fentanyl** or a **long\u2011acting** opioid (methadone, extended\u2011release oxycodone/morphine)\n  - he used **alcohol, benzos (Xanax/Valium), sleep meds**, or other sedatives\n  - he took a large amount or multiple substances\n\nFifteen minutes of being okay is **not** enough to be confident he\u2019s safe.\n\n### What to do now (practical steps)\n1. **Call 911 now.** Say: \u201cHe was unresponsive with agonal/shallow breathing, I gave naloxone, he woke up, but needs monitoring.\u201d\n2. **Do not let him go to sleep.** Keep him awake and observed.\n3. Keep the **Narcan ready**. If he gets sleepy, breathing slows, or you can\u2019t keep him awake:\n   - give another dose (per kit directions; often repeat every **2\u20133 minutes** if breathing is inadequate)\n   - start **rescue breathing** if he\u2019s not breathing normally\n4. If he lies down, put him **on his side (recovery position)**.\n\n### If he refuses EMS\nEven then, the safest move is still to call. If he absolutely will not go, he needs **continuous, in\u2011person monitoring for several hours** (not \u201ccheck on him later\u201d), and you should be ready to redose naloxone and call 911 the moment he becomes drowsy or breathing changes. But refusal is common after naloxone because it can cause withdrawal/agitation\u2014**that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s safe.**\n\nIf you can answer quickly: **What did he take (if known), and was it a nasal Narcan spray or injection, and how many doses?**",
        "You can\u2019t make him accept an ambulance, but you **should still call 911**. A person can be awake and coherent after naloxone and still **stop breathing again** when it wears off. Prior times \u201cbeing fine\u201d doesn\u2019t predict this time.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about cost, you can tell dispatch you need **medical evaluation for an overdose reversal** and ask if they can send **EMS for assessment**; in many places they can evaluate on scene and help decide next steps. But the safest option is still EMS/ER monitoring.\n\n### If he refuses to go, do this to reduce risk (not as safe as EMS)\n**1) Do not let him sleep unattended.**\n- \u201cSleeping it off\u201d is exactly when people re-sedate and die.\n- If he insists on lying down, put him in the **recovery position** (on his side).\n\n**2) Continuous monitoring for several hours.**\n- Stay with him and watch for: slowing breathing, snoring/gurgling, turning pale/blue, can\u2019t stay awake, confusion.\n- If you have a pulse oximeter: **<94%** or dropping is concerning; **<90% is an emergency**.\n\n**3) Keep naloxone ready and re-dose if needed.**\nGive another dose **immediately** if:\n- breathing becomes slow/shallow/irregular,\n- he can\u2019t stay awake or you can\u2019t wake him,\n- lips/skin look blue/gray,\n- you hear \u201cdeath rattle\u201d/gurgling/snoring with poor breathing.\n\nMany kits: repeat **every 2\u20133 minutes** until he\u2019s breathing normally. (Follow your product instructions.)\n\n**4) Be ready to do rescue breathing/CPR.**\n- If he\u2019s not breathing normally: **call 911**, start **rescue breaths** (1 breath every ~5\u20136 seconds) and continue until he breathes or help arrives.\n- If no pulse, start CPR.\n\n**5) Avoid anything that increases risk.**\n- **No alcohol, benzos, sleep meds, or more opioids.**\n- Don\u2019t let him take a \u201csmall amount\u201d to feel better\u2014this is a common fatal setup after naloxone.\n\n### When to call 911 even if he\u2019s refusing right now\nCall immediately if any of these happen:\n- he becomes hard to wake, confused, or \u201cnods off\u201d\n- breathing slows, becomes shallow, or you notice long pauses\n- blue/gray lips or fingertips\n- vomiting, choking, seizure, chest pain\n\n### One more important point\nIf he\u2019s refusing because he\u2019s afraid of withdrawal or legal trouble: many areas have **Good Samaritan** protections for overdose calls, and EMS can treat withdrawal symptoms and keep him safe. Cost concerns are real, but they\u2019re not worth the risk of him dying in his sleep.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what substance he took (or if it might be fentanyl/unknown pill),\n- how many naloxone doses and what type (nasal/injection),\n- whether he used alcohol/benzos,\nI can help you judge how high the rebound-risk is and how long you should monitor\u2014but **please call 911 now** if you haven\u2019t already.",
