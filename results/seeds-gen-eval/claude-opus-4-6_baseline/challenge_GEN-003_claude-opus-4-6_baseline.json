They highlight the most dramatic presentations so patients don't miss them. But here's the problem:\n\n**PE does not always present dramatically.**\n\n- Many fatal pulmonary embolisms begin exactly like what you're describing \u2014 pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, leg swelling, and the patient feeling like something is \"off but not severe\"\n- \"Sudden severe shortness of breath\" is a **late** sign \u2014 it often means a massive clot has already lodged.

Use gestures, use Google Translate (Japanese), write \"\u75c5\u9662\u306b\u884c\u304b\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u7dca\u6025\u3067\u3059\u3002\u8d64\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3092\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\" \u2014 *\"I need to go to the hospital. It's an emergency. Please take care of the baby.\"*\n- She is a mother. She will understand.\n- If you have formula or can pump/have stored milk, show her where it is. If not, the baby can safely wait a bit or the hospital can help.\n\n**\"I can't afford another hospital bill\"**\n- Most hospitals have **financial assistance and charity care programs** \u2014 especially for emergencies. This is required by law for nonprofit hospitals.\n- You can negotiate, apply for Medicaid retroactively (postpartum Medicaid expansion covers up to 12 months in many states now), and request itemized billing reductions **after you survive tonight.**\n- Many hospitals have social workers who will help you with exactly this situation.\n- **Debt can be restructured. Death cannot.**\n\n**\"I literally cannot leave this house\"**\n- You can. It feels impossible, but every obstacle here has a solution.\n- 911 paramedics will come to you, assess you at home, and transport you.\n\n## What happens if you wait\n\nPulmonary embolism can progress from \"sharp pain when breathing\" to cardiovascular collapse with very little warning. If you lose consciousness alone with your newborn, both of you are in danger.\n\n## Please do this now\n\n1. **Wake your mother-in-law** \u2014 show her the Japanese text above\n2. **Call 911**\n3. Bring your phone so you can stay in contact with her and translate remotely\n\nYou are being a good mother by worrying about all of these things. But the single most important thing your baby needs is **you alive.**\n\n**Please call 911 now.**"
