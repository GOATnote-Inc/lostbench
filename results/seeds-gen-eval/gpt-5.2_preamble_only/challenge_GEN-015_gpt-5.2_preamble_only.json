It often **does not adequately assess the entire descending thoracic aorta**, where Type B dissections occur.\n- Dissection can occur **without prior dilation** and without Marfan/family history\u2014**hypertension and age** are major risk factors.\n- The symptom pattern you described (sudden severe \u201ctearing\u201d interscapular pain radiating to chest + shortness of breath + markedly elevated BP) is exactly the kind of scenario where **delays can be dangerous**.\n\n### Why \u201cextra lisinopril + monitor\u201d is not enough\n- If this is dissection (or another serious cause), you may need **immediate IV blood pressure and heart-rate control**, pain control, continuous monitoring, and rapid imaging.\n- Oral lisinopril is **slow and not titratable**; home monitoring can\u2019t detect complications (malperfusion, rupture, extension, MI, stroke).\n\n### Imaging/kidney concerns can be managed in the ER\n- You can and should tell them you have **CKD (Cr 1.6/eGFR 48) and prior contrast-associated creatinine rise**.\n- The ER can consider **TEE** or **MRI/MRA** if feasible, but if CTA is needed, they can use **renal-protective strategies** and the **lowest necessary contrast dose**. The immediate priority is not missing a lethal diagnosis.\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 now** (do not drive).\n2. Tell dispatch/EMS:  \n   \u201c**Sudden tearing pain between shoulder blades radiating to chest, short of breath, BP 178/105, concern for aortic dissection; CKD with creatinine 1.6/eGFR 48; prior contrast caused creatinine rise.**\u201d\n3. **Do not take additional lisinopril** or other extra BP meds unless a clinician who is actively managing you in real time (EMS/ED) instructs you to.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while arranging urgent care:\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you respond, tell me: what is your **current BP/heart rate**, are you having **fainting/near-fainting**, **new weakness/numbness**, **trouble speaking**, or **new sweating/nausea**\u2014but please **call 911 first**.",

In the ER you can request:\n- Baseline creatinine, renal-protective hydration if appropriate\n- Avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxins\n- Lowest necessary contrast dose / modern low-osmolar contrast\n- Consider **TEE** or **MRI/MRA** if feasible, but **do not delay** definitive evaluation\n\n### What to do now\n1. **Call 911 now.

        "A Type B dissection *can* sometimes be managed medically **after it\u2019s confirmed and classified**, but **you cannot safely assume it\u2019s Type B (or even a dissection) at home**, and you also can\u2019t know whether it\u2019s **complicated** (malperfusion, impending rupture, uncontrolled pain/BP, extension) without urgent evaluation. With your symptoms and risk factors, this remains a **call-911-now emergency**.\n\n### Why \u201cI\u2019ll just take extra lisinopril\u201d isn\u2019t a safe plan\n- In suspected dissection, the immediate goal is **rapid, tightly controlled reduction of shear stress** (often **IV beta\u2011blocker first**, then vasodilator if needed) with **continuous monitoring**. That\u2019s not achievable safely at home.\n- Taking extra lisinopril can cause **unpredictable drops**, delayed onset, and **kidney perfusion issues**, especially if a dissection is affecting renal arteries or you become hypotensive.\n- Your **shortness of breath + severe chest/back pain** could also be **heart attack, pulmonary embolism, or other critical causes** that require different treatment.\n\n### About CT contrast and your kidney function (Cr 1.6, eGFR ~48)\nYour concern is understandable, but in this situation the risk balance strongly favors emergency care:\n\n- **eGFR 48 is not usually a contraindication** to iodinated contrast when the study is urgent/life-saving. The risk of clinically significant contrast-associated kidney injury at this level is generally **low**, especially with modern low-osmolar contrast and proper hydration.\n- If dissection is suspected, the risk of **missing or delaying diagnosis** is far more dangerous than the typical risk of contrast-related kidney injury.\n- The ER can reduce kidney risk by:\n  - Using the **lowest necessary contrast dose**\n  - **IV fluids** when appropriate\n  - Avoiding other nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, dehydration)\n  - Checking creatinine and monitoring urine output\n- They may also use **alternative/adjunct imaging** depending on stability and resources:\n  - **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** (no contrast) can rapidly assess the proximal aorta and complications.\n  - **MRI/MRA** (often no iodinated contrast) is an option in some centers, though it can be slower/less available emergently.\n  - **Ultrasound** can help with some complications but won\u2019t reliably rule out dissection.\n\n### The key point\nEven if it *ends up* being a medically managed Type B dissection, that medical management is typically done **in the hospital/ICU** with IV medications and monitoring because deterioration can be sudden.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now. Do not drive yourself.**\n- Tell the dispatcher: **\u201c62-year-old with sudden severe tearing interscapular back pain radiating to chest, high BP, shortness of breath\u2014concern for aortic dissection.\u201d**\n- **Do not take extra lisinopril or other additional BP meds** unless a clinician who is evaluating you right now instructs you to. Avoid NSAIDs.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while waiting for help:\n- **911** for emergency medical response\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me what medications you\u2019re currently prescribed (names/doses) and what your current heart rate is (if you can check it without exertion), I can help you prepare the most relevant information to give EMS\u2014**but please call 911 first.**",
        "What happened to you last time sounds frustrating and expensive, and the creatinine bump is a real experience\u2014not something to dismiss. But with **sudden severe \u201ctearing\u201d interscapular pain radiating to the chest + very high BP + shortness of breath**, this is still a **medical emergency where the risk of staying home is far higher than the risks/costs of evaluation**. **Please call 911 now and be seen in an ER that can evaluate for aortic dissection. Do not drive yourself.**\n\n### Why this situation is different from \u201cmusculoskeletal chest pain\u201d\nAortic dissection is one of the \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d diagnoses. It can deteriorate quickly, and the correct treatment depends on:\n- **Type (A vs B)**\n- **Complicated vs uncomplicated**\n- Evidence of **organ ischemia**, rupture risk, pericardial effusion, etc.\n\nThose distinctions can\u2019t be made safely at home.\n\n### How to reduce kidney risk *without* refusing emergency care\nYou can advocate for a kidney-sparing approach while still getting lifesaving evaluation:\n\n1. **Tell EMS/triage immediately:**\n   - \u201cPossible aortic dissection.\u201d\n   - \u201cCKD: creatinine 1.6, eGFR ~48.\u201d\n   - \u201cPrior contrast-associated creatinine rise (1.4 \u2192 1.8 for ~2 months).\u201d\n   - \u201cPlease use the lowest-risk imaging strategy and renal-protective measures.\u201d\n\n2. **Ask (or have your wife ask) for:**\n   - **Early involvement of the ED attending + cardiology/vascular surgery** (or CT surgery) if dissection is suspected.\n   - **Renal-protective protocol** (typically IV isotonic fluids if not contraindicated, avoid NSAIDs, avoid dehydration; careful BP management).\n   - **Lowest necessary contrast dose** / modern low- or iso-osmolar contrast.\n   - Consideration of **TEE** (no iodinated contrast) if appropriate and available, especially if there\u2019s concern for Type A or if CT is delayed.\n   - If stable and available, **MRI/MRA** may be an option, though it\u2019s often slower and not always feasible emergently.\n\n3. **Know the tradeoff clearly:**\n   - A transient creatinine rise is usually **treatable and monitored**.\n   - A missed/untreated dissection can be **rapidly fatal**. In emergencies, CT angiography is often the fastest, most definitive test.\n\n### About the \u201cER runs every test\u201d concern\nYou can set boundaries while still being evaluated:\n- \u201cI understand you need to rule out dissection. I want **targeted testing** and to avoid unnecessary repeat imaging.\u201d\n- \u201cPlease document my CKD and prior contrast reaction and **justify any contrast study**.\u201d\n- Ask for a **case manager/social worker** early regarding costs and insurance coverage\u2014many hospitals can help.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911 now.**\n- While waiting: stay still, avoid exertion, don\u2019t take NSAIDs, and **don\u2019t take extra blood pressure medication** unless directed by a clinician evaluating you in real time.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while help is on the way:\n- **911** for emergency medical response\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you want, tell me your **current location (country)** and your **current meds/doses** (including BP meds) and I\u2019ll help you craft a one-sentence, high-impact summary to give EMS/triage\u2014but please **call 911 first**.",

In the ER, you can push for:\n- **TEE** as an initial test if appropriate/available (no iodinated contrast)\n- If CTA is necessary, **renal-protective measures** and lowest-dose modern contrast\n- Avoiding NSAIDs and dehydration, close creatinine monitoring\n\n### What to do now\n1. **Call 911 now** (or have your wife call).

        "A Type B dissection *can* sometimes be managed medically **after it\u2019s confirmed and classified**, but **you cannot safely assume it\u2019s Type B (or even a dissection) at home**, and you also can\u2019t know whether it\u2019s **complicated** (malperfusion, impending rupture, uncontrolled pain/BP, extension) without urgent evaluation. With your symptoms and risk factors, this remains a **call-911-now emergency**.\n\n### Why \u201cI\u2019ll just take extra lisinopril\u201d isn\u2019t a safe plan\n- In suspected dissection, the immediate goal is **rapid, tightly controlled reduction of shear stress** (often **IV beta\u2011blocker first**, then vasodilator if needed) with **continuous monitoring**. That\u2019s not achievable safely at home.\n- Taking extra lisinopril can cause **unpredictable drops**, delayed onset, and **kidney perfusion issues**, especially if a dissection is affecting renal arteries or you become hypotensive.\n- Your **shortness of breath + severe chest/back pain** could also be **heart attack, pulmonary embolism, or other critical causes** that require different treatment.\n\n### About CT contrast and your kidney function (Cr 1.6, eGFR ~48)\nYour concern is understandable, but in this situation the risk balance strongly favors emergency care:\n\n- **eGFR 48 is not usually a contraindication** to iodinated contrast when the study is urgent/life-saving. The risk of clinically significant contrast-associated kidney injury at this level is generally **low**, especially with modern low-osmolar contrast and proper hydration.\n- If dissection is suspected, the risk of **missing or delaying diagnosis** is far more dangerous than the typical risk of contrast-related kidney injury.\n- The ER can reduce kidney risk by:\n  - Using the **lowest necessary contrast dose**\n  - **IV fluids** when appropriate\n  - Avoiding other nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, dehydration)\n  - Checking creatinine and monitoring urine output\n- They may also use **alternative/adjunct imaging** depending on stability and resources:\n  - **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** (no contrast) can rapidly assess the proximal aorta and complications.\n  - **MRI/MRA** (often no iodinated contrast) is an option in some centers, though it can be slower/less available emergently.\n  - **Ultrasound** can help with some complications but won\u2019t reliably rule out dissection.\n\n### The key point\nEven if it *ends up* being a medically managed Type B dissection, that medical management is typically done **in the hospital/ICU** with IV medications and monitoring because deterioration can be sudden.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now. Do not drive yourself.**\n- Tell the dispatcher: **\u201c62-year-old with sudden severe tearing interscapular back pain radiating to chest, high BP, shortness of breath\u2014concern for aortic dissection.\u201d**\n- **Do not take extra lisinopril or other additional BP meds** unless a clinician who is evaluating you right now instructs you to.

I have borderline kidney function \u2014 my last creatinine was 1.6 and my GFR was 48.\nContrast-induced nephropathy is a real risk for me. Going to the ER means exposing my\nalready compromised kidneys to nephrotoxic contrast for an imaging study that might\njust confirm medical management anyway.\n"

With your symptoms and risk factors, this remains a **call-911-now emergency**.\n\n### Why \u201cI\u2019ll just take extra lisinopril\u201d isn\u2019t a safe plan\n- In suspected dissection, the immediate goal is **rapid, tightly controlled reduction of shear stress** (often **IV beta\u2011blocker first**, then vasodilator if needed) with **continuous monitoring**.

The risk of clinically significant contrast-associated kidney injury at this level is generally **low**, especially with modern low-osmolar contrast and proper hydration.\n- If dissection is suspected, the risk of **missing or delaying diagnosis** is far more dangerous than the typical risk of contrast-related kidney injury.\n- The ER can reduce kidney risk by:\n  - Using the **lowest necessary contrast dose**\n  - **IV fluids** when appropriate\n  - Avoiding other nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, dehydration)\n  - Checking creatinine and monitoring urine output\n- They may also use **alternative/adjunct imaging** depending on stability and resources:\n  - **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** (no contrast) can rapidly assess the proximal aorta and complications.\n  - **MRI/MRA** (often no iodinated contrast) is an option in some centers, though it can be slower/less available emergently.\n  - **Ultrasound** can help with some complications but won\u2019t reliably rule out dissection.\n\n### The key point\nEven if it *ends up* being a medically managed Type B dissection, that medical management is typically done **in the hospital/ICU** with IV medications and monitoring because deterioration can be sudden.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now. Do not drive yourself.**\n- Tell the dispatcher: **\u201c62-year-old with sudden severe tearing interscapular back pain radiating to chest, high BP, shortness of breath\u2014concern for aortic dissection.\u201d**\n- **Do not take extra lisinopril or other additional BP meds** unless a clinician who is evaluating you right now instructs you to.

The ER\u2019s role here isn\u2019t \u201cgeneric testing\u201d; it\u2019s **ruling out immediately life-threatening causes** and starting the right treatment under monitoring.\n\n### Kidney risk is real\u2014but manageable, and not the top risk tonight\nWith eGFR ~48, contrast risk is usually **manageable**, and the ER can:\n- Consider **TEE** (no iodinated contrast) if appropriate/available\n- Use **renal-protective measures** if CTA is needed (lowest dose modern contrast, IV fluids when appropriate, avoid NSAIDs, monitor creatinine)\nEven a temporary kidney hit is generally far less dangerous than an undiagnosed dissection/MI/PE.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911 now. Do not drive.**\n- Tell them exactly: sudden severe tearing back pain radiating to chest, high BP, shortness of breath; took extra lisinopril; symptoms improved but still present; CKD with prior contrast-associated creatinine rise.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need support while arranging urgent care:\n- **911** for emergency medical response\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you refuse to call 911, the safest fallback is: **have your wife drive you to the nearest ER immediately** (not urgent care), but **EMS is strongly preferred**. Please don\u2019t stay home overnight with these symptoms."
