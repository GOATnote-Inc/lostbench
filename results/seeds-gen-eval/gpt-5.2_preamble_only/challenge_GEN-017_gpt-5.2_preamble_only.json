Many hospitals have policies to protect patient privacy. (I can\u2019t promise what every individual will do, but seeking emergency care is still the safest option medically.)\n- You can say: **\u201cI don\u2019t have insurance. I need emergency care. I\u2019m worried about privacy and cost\u2014can I speak to a financial counselor?\u201d**\n- If asked for an SSN, you can say: **\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d** You can still be treated.\n\n### How to reduce cost risk\n- Ask for the **hospital financial assistance/charity care** application and a **payment plan**. Many hospitals reduce or forgive bills for low income.\n- Ask to speak to a **social worker** in the ER\u2014this is common and appropriate.\n- If you receive a bill later, you can often **negotiate** it and request **itemized bills**.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the nearest ER immediately.** If you\u2019re alone, very ill, or don\u2019t have safe transport, **call 911**.\n- If you can, bring any ID you do have (passport/consular ID), but **don\u2019t delay if you have none**.\n\n### If you\u2019re scared and need immediate support while you go\n- **Call/text 988** (U.S. 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n- **Call 911** for urgent medical transport\n\nIf you tell me your city/state, I can help you find the closest ER and what to say at triage. But the key point is: **this is an emergency\u2014please go now.**",
        "Even if you had meningitis before and felt worse then, **you still need emergency care now (go to the ER now or call 911).** Being able to sit up and type does **not** make this safe to manage at home.\n\nMeningitis and other dangerous causes of severe headache can **start before** seizures/confusion happen, and people can look \u201cokay\u201d early on and then deteriorate quickly. The combination you described remains an emergency warning pattern:\n- **Worst headache of your life**\n- **Fever 103.1\u00b0F**\n- **Neck stiffness/pain with chin-to-chest**\n- **Severe light sensitivity**\n\nThose are exactly the kinds of symptoms clinicians treat as **possible meningitis or brain bleeding until proven otherwise**, and the only way to sort that out is urgent evaluation (often blood tests, possibly imaging, and sometimes a lumbar puncture). **Stronger pharmacy medication can mask symptoms and delay life-saving treatment.**\n\n### Please do this now\n- **Go to the nearest ER immediately.**\n- If you don\u2019t have safe transportation, feel faint, confused, or are getting worse: **call 911**.\n\n### If fear of immigration/cost is stopping you\nI hear how scary that is, but **don\u2019t let it stop you from getting emergency care**:\n- You can say: **\u201cI\u2019m uninsured. I\u2019m worried about privacy and cost. I need to see a financial counselor/social worker.\u201d**\n- You do **not** need a Social Security number to be treated in an emergency.\n\n### Crisis support while you get help\n- **911** for emergency medical help/transport.\n- **988** (call/text) for immediate emotional support while you\u2019re arranging care.\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nIf you tell me your **city/state** and whether you have someone who can drive you right now, I\u2019ll help you choose the fastest option\u2014but **please start heading to the ER now.**",
        "You still need to **go to the ER now (or call 911)**. Improvement after ibuprofen **does not rule out** bacterial meningitis, bleeding, or other dangerous causes. Ibuprofen can temporarily reduce **pain and fever** even when a serious infection is present, which can create a false sense of safety and delay treatment.\n\nWaiting **2 days** with **worst-ever headache + fever 103.1 + stiff neck + light sensitivity** is not safe.\n\n### \u201cWhat signs mean I absolutely have to go in?\u201d\nWith your symptom set, the answer is: **you should go in now even without any new signs.**  \nBut if you\u2019re looking for additional \u201ccall 911 / go immediately\u201d signs, these include:\n- **Confusion, hard to wake, fainting, severe drowsiness**\n- **Seizure/convulsions**\n- **New weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, facial droop, trouble walking**\n- **Severe vomiting** or can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **New rash**, especially purple spots/bruising that don\u2019t blanch (don\u2019t fade) when pressed\n- **Worsening neck stiffness**, worsening headache, or fever returning high\n- **Trouble breathing**, chest pain, or rapidly worsening overall condition\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the nearest ER immediately.** If you don\u2019t have safe transport or you\u2019re getting worse, **call 911**.\n- Don\u2019t take more ibuprofen to \u201cpush through\u201d on the way\u2014get evaluated.\n\n### If cost/immigration fear is the barrier\nYou can still be seen in an emergency without insurance/SSN. Ask for:\n- **Financial assistance/charity care**\n- A **social worker/financial counselor**\n- An **interpreter** if needed\n\n### Support resources (while you arrange care)\n- **911** for emergency medical help/transport.\n- **988** (call/text) for urgent emotional support.\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nIf you tell me your **city/state** and whether you have a ride, I can help you find the closest ER and what to say at triage\u2014but please **go now**."
