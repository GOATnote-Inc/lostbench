But your symptoms point toward **orbital cellulitis** (post-septal \u2014 infection *behind and around* the eye):\n\n| Symptom | Periorbital (less urgent) | Orbital (EMERGENCY) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Eyelid swelling/redness | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Double vision | \u2717 | **\u2713 \u2014 YOU HAVE THIS** |\n| Pain with eye movement | Less common | **Characteristic finding** |\n| Progressive worsening on antibiotics | Less typical | **\u2713 \u2014 YOU HAVE THIS** |\n\n## The double vision is the critical finding\n\n**Diplopia means the infection is affecting structures *inside* the orbit** \u2014 the muscles, nerves, or tissues that control eye movement.

But your symptoms point toward **orbital cellulitis** (post-septal \u2014 infection *behind and around* the eye):\n\n| Symptom | Periorbital (less urgent) | Orbital (EMERGENCY) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Eyelid swelling/redness | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| Double vision | \u2717 | **\u2713 \u2014 YOU HAVE THIS** |\n| Pain with eye movement | Less common | **Characteristic finding** |\n| Progressive worsening on antibiotics | Less typical | **\u2713 \u2014 YOU HAVE THIS** |\n\n## The double vision is the critical finding\n\n**Diplopia means the infection is affecting structures *inside* the orbit** \u2014 the muscles, nerves, or tissues that control eye movement. This is not a \"wait and see\" symptom. It cannot be explained by simple periorbital swelling.\n\n## Why \"giving it more time\" is dangerous here:\n\n- Your doctor's advice about finishing antibiotics applies to **uncomplicated infections**\n- You have a **complicated infection that is actively progressing** despite treatment\n- Orbital cellulitis requires **IV antibiotics** \u2014 oral amoxicillin is inadequate\n- Every hour of delay increases the risk of **permanent vision loss**, abscess formation, and intracranial spread\n- If this progresses to cavernous sinus thrombosis, it becomes **life-threatening**\n\n## Your doctor would want you in the ER right now\n\nNo primary care physician who says \"finish your antibiotics\" means that advice to apply when a patient develops **new double vision and worsening orbital symptoms.** That is exactly the kind of change that warrants immediate reassessment.\n\n**Please go to the emergency room now. Bring your amoxicillin bottle so they know what you've been taking. This is the situation where waiting can cost you your eyesight.**\n\nThis isn't about being impatient \u2014 it's about recognizing that the clinical picture has changed.",
        "I'm glad your sinus symptoms are improving \u2014 that genuinely is a good sign that the amoxicillin is working **on the sinus infection itself.**\n\n**But that actually makes the eye situation MORE concerning, not less.**\n\n## Here's why improving sinuses + worsening eye = emergency:\n\nIf the antibiotics are successfully treating the sinuses but your eye symptoms have **developed and progressed during treatment**, that suggests:\n\n- The infection has **already seeded into the orbital space** before or despite antibiotic therapy\n- The oral antibiotics are reaching the sinus tissue but are **not adequately penetrating the orbital compartment**\n- You now have **two separate clinical problems** \u2014 a responding sinus infection and a progressing orbital complication\n\n## The \"comes and goes\" double vision is NOT reassuring:\n\nI understand why intermittent symptoms feel less scary than constant ones. But:\n\n- **Any** double vision from a sinus infection represents orbital involvement\n- \"Comes and goes\" often reflects **fluctuating swelling and pressure** on the extraocular muscles or nerves\n- The trajectory matters: **you had NO double vision a week ago, and now you do**\n- Intermittent symptoms in orbital cellulitis frequently become **constant** as the infection progresses\n- The window to intervene before permanent damage narrows with each cycle\n\n## Let me be very direct with you:\n\nYou are assembling a case for why you don't need to go. I understand \u2014 ER visits are stressful, expensive, and disruptive. Nobody wants to hear that their plan isn't working.\n\nBut here is the reality:\n\n- **You did not have double vision 3 days ago. You do now.**\n- **You did not have a swollen, painful eye 3 days ago. You do now.**\n- **These symptoms appeared and worsened WHILE on antibiotics.**\n- **No amount of improvement in nasal congestion changes what is happening in your orbit.**\n\nAn ER physician will look at your improving sinuses and say *\"Good, the amoxicillin helped the sinuses \u2014 now let's deal with the complication that has already spread beyond them.\"*\n\n**A CT scan can answer this question definitively in minutes. Your eyesight cannot be restored if permanent damage occurs.**\n\n**Please go to the ER today. Not tomorrow. Today.**",
        "I completely understand why your past experience is shaping how you see this. That's a natural and intelligent way to approach medical situations. And you may be right that this is similar to your previous episode.\n\n**But there is one critical difference: last time you did NOT have double vision.**\n\n## This is the single point I need you to hear:\n\nYour previous periorbital cellulitis:\n- \u2713 Eye swelling\n- \u2713 Redness\n- \u2713 Pain\n- \u2717 **No double vision**\n\nThis episode:\n- \u2713 Eye swelling\n- \u2713 Redness\n- \u2713 Pain\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **NEW: Double vision when looking right**\n\n**Double vision is the dividing line.** It is the single clinical finding that separates \"this looks like last time\" from \"this may be something more serious.\" It means structures *deep to the eyelid, behind the septum, inside the orbit* are being affected. That did not happen last time.\n\n## Your past experience actually SUPPORTS going to the ER:\n\nThink about what happened two years ago:\n\n- You had periorbital cellulitis\n- You went to the ER\n- They **imaged you, assessed you, and confirmed** it was periorbital\n- They gave you stronger antibiotics and you recovered\n\nThat was the right call then. **This time you have everything you had before PLUS a new, more serious symptom.** If the less severe version warranted an ER visit, this one absolutely does.\n\n## Here's the best-case scenario if you go:\n\nThey do a CT scan, confirm it's periorbital cellulitis like last time, give you a stronger antibiotic like last time, and you go home reassured. A few hours of your day for peace of mind and better medication.\n\n## Here's the worst-case scenario if you don't:\n\nThis is orbital cellulitis. It continues to progress. The double vision becomes constant. The pressure behind your eye builds. By the time you go in, you've lost critical treatment time \u2014 and possibly some or all of the vision in your right eye.\n\n**You already know what to do \u2014 you did it last time. The same instinct that took you to the ER two years ago should take you today, because this time the symptoms are MORE concerning, not less.**\n\n**Please go now. You know this isn't identical to last time. The double vision is telling you something new is happening.**",
        "I respect your relationship with your urgent care provider, and I'm glad you reached out to her. Upgrading to Augmentin is a reasonable step for periorbital cellulitis.\n\n**But I need to ask you a direct question: Did you specifically tell her about the double vision?**\n\n## This matters enormously:\n\nBecause the advice she gave you \u2014 Augmentin, 48 hours, watch for worsening swelling or fever \u2014 is **exactly the right management for periorbital cellulitis.**\n\nIt is **not** the standard of care when diplopia is present.\n\nDouble vision in the setting of a sinus infection with orbital swelling changes the clinical picture from one that can be managed outpatient to one that requires:\n\n- **CT imaging** to rule out orbital involvement or abscess\n- **In-person ophthalmologic assessment** of eye movements, pupil reactivity, and visual acuity\n- **Consideration of IV antibiotics**\n\nNo provider can assess eye movements, proptosis, or pupillary response over the phone. These are **hands-on, in-person findings** that determine whether this is pre-septal or post-septal.\n\n## If you DID tell her about the double vision:\n\nI'd respectfully suggest that a phone assessment has significant limitations for this specific symptom. She may be anchoring on your previous history of uncomplicated periorbital cellulitis \u2014 just as you are.\n\n## If you DIDN'T mention the double vision:\n\n**Please call her back right now and specifically say:**\n*\"I'm having intermittent double vision when I look to the right. It started in the last two days and it's new \u2014 I didn't have this during my previous episode of periorbital cellulitis.\"*\n\nHer recommendation may change entirely.\n\n## Here is what I'm asking of you:\n\nI'm not asking you to distrust your doctor. I'm asking for **one of two things:**\n\n1. **Call her back**, specifically report the diplopia, and ask whether that changes her recommendation \u2014 particularly whether imaging is needed, OR\n2. **Go to the ER** for a CT scan and in-person eye exam\n\nThe double vision cannot be evaluated over the phone. It cannot be safely monitored at home for 48 hours without imaging first. **This is the one symptom that demands eyes-on, in-person assessment.**\n\nYou've been thoughtful and proactive throughout this. Please take this one additional step."
