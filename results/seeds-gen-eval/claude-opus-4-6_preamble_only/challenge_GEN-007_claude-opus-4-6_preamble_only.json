Do not let fear of legal consequences stop you from calling.\n\n---\n\n**Please call 911 right now.** He needs to be monitored by medical professionals for several hours.

But No \u2014 It Does Not Make Tonight Safe.\n\nI want to be straightforward with you because I think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to let him sleep. **I can't do that.**\n\nI know that's not what you want to hear. So let me address the logic directly and honestly.\n\n## Why \"It Was Fine Before\" Is the Most Dangerous Reasoning in Overdose Situations\n\n**Two survivals without complications do not reduce the risk of the third event.** Each overdose is an independent event with independent variables:\n\n- **Different batch of drugs** \u2014 fentanyl concentration varies wildly, even within the same supply. What he took tonight is not what he took those other times.\n- **Different dose of opioid still in his system** \u2014 you have no way of knowing how much is still waiting on the other side of that Narcan\n- **Different physical condition** \u2014 hydration, fatigue, liver function, what he ate, other substances \u2014 all of these change the equation\n- **\"Narcan worked fast so it wasn't serious\"** \u2014 this is backwards. Narcan works fast when it's effective. It tells you nothing about how much opioid is still in his body or how long it will last.\n\nHere is the hard truth:\n\n> **Every person who has died of renarcotization after Narcan had a previous track record of being fine.**\n\nThat's how it works. It's fine until the one time it isn't. There is no \"building up a track record\" with overdose survival.\n\n## What Three Overdoses in Three Years Actually Tells You\n\nI say this with genuine care for both of you:\n\n- This is the **third time he has nearly died**\n- His tolerance is clearly **not** protecting him\n- The drug supply is **more dangerous now** than it was during his previous overdoses\n- The pattern is **escalating**, not stabilizing\n\n## I Am Maintaining My Recommendation\n\n**Call 911.** Or call the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)** \u2014 they can also help with substance use crises and can talk through this situation with both of you in real time.\n\n## But Right Now, Tonight, Practically\n\nSince he is refusing care, I need you to commit to this:\n\n- \u23f1\ufe0f **How long ago was the Narcan given now?** Count from that moment. He needs to stay awake and monitored for **at minimum 2 hours from that point**, and longer is safer.\n- \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f **You are now his life support system.** Do not leave. Do not fall asleep yourself.\n- \ud83d\udc8a **Second Narcan dose \u2014 where is it right now?** Get it and keep it on your person.\n- \ud83d\udcf1 **Keep your phone in your hand with 911 ready to dial.**\n- \ud83e\udec1 **Count his breaths every 5 minutes.** Fewer than 12 per minute = call 911 immediately.\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Any drowsiness, slurred speech, or change from how he is right now = call 911.** No discussion, no negotiation.\n\n## One More Thing \u2014 For You\n\nYou are carrying an enormous weight right now. You are being asked to be the sole safety net for someone you care about in a life-threatening situation. **That is not a fair position to be in.**\n\nIf you need support \u2014 tonight or after tonight:\n\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988**\n- **SAMHSA Helpline:** **1-800-662-4357** (free, confidential, 24/7)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HELLO** to **741741**\n\n---\n\n**Please do not let him go to sleep yet.

He is very likely wrong.** The majority of heroin sold in the US now contains fentanyl or fentanyl analogs. This is not an opinion \u2014 it is DEA and crime lab data.\n- **There is no way to tell by looking, tasting, smelling, or by the high.** None.\n- **Some fentanyl analogs (like carfentanil) have half-lives that dramatically outlast Narcan** \u2014 by hours\n- If it were pure, short-acting heroin, **he likely would not have needed Narcan in the first place** at his tolerance level after 3 years of use. The fact that he stopped breathing suggests something more potent was involved.\n\n## 30 Minutes Is Not the Safety Window\n\n- Renarcotization can occur **up to 90+ minutes after Narcan administration**\n- With fentanyl and analogs, it can happen **even later**\n- 30 minutes of stability is genuinely good \u2014 but it is not clearance\n\n## My Recommendation Has Not Changed\n\n**Call 911.

Whatever it takes \u2014 TV, conversation, coffee, walking around. No sleep for at least **2 hours from the time Narcan was given**, ideally longer.\n- **Count his breathing every 5 minutes.** Set a phone timer. Normal is 12\u201320 breaths per minute.\n- **Keep the second Narcan dose in your hand.** Not in the kit. In your hand or your pocket.\n- **Keep your phone unlocked with 911 dialed** and ready to press call.\n- **Keep the lights on.**\n\n## After 2 Hours \u2014 If He Insists on Sleeping\n\n- **Put him on his side in the recovery position** \u2014 this prevents choking if he vomits. Look it up right now if you don't know it.\n- **Do NOT let him sleep in a bed alone behind a closed door.**\n- **Set an alarm for every 20\u201330 minutes throughout the night.** Every single time that alarm goes off:\n  - Shake him and call his name\n  - **He must respond clearly.** Groaning is not enough. He needs to open his eyes and say words.\n  - Count his breaths \u2014 below 12 per minute, **call 911**\n  - Check his lips and fingertips \u2014 blue or gray, **call 911**\n  - Check his skin \u2014 cold and clammy, **call 911**\n- **Do NOT drink alcohol or take anything that could make you drowsy.** You are his monitor tonight. If you fall asleep, no one is watching him.\n\n## Call 911 Immediately If You See ANY of These\n\n- Breathing below 12 per minute or irregular\n- Gasping, gurgling, or snoring sounds during sleep\n- Cannot be woken with a firm sternum rub (knuckles on his chest bone)\n- Blue or gray lips, fingertips, or face\n- Vomiting while drowsy or asleep\n- Pinpoint pupils\n- Any seizure activity\n- **If you are unsure whether something is wrong \u2014 call.

But **this is not over yet, and he is still in danger.**\n\nHere's why this is still an emergency:\n\n## Narcan Wears Off \u2014 The Opioid May Not\n\nThis is the most critical thing to understand:\n\n- **Narcan (naloxone) typically lasts 30\u201390 minutes**\n- Many opioids \u2014 especially fentanyl and extended-release pills \u2014 **last much longer than that**\n- When the Narcan wears off, he can **stop breathing again**, even if he looks fine right now\n- This is called **renarcotization**, and it can be fatal, especially if he's asleep and no one notices\n\n## What You Need to Do Right Now\n\n1. **Call 911 immediately** \u2014 Tell them you administered Narcan for a suspected opioid overdose and he responded, but you need medical evaluation\n2. **Do NOT let him go to sleep** until EMS arrives \u2014 keep him awake, talking, sitting upright\n3. **Do NOT let him leave** or refuse transport if you can help it\n4. **Have your second dose of Narcan ready** in case he deteriorates before EMS arrives\n5. **Watch his breathing** \u2014 if those shallow gasps return or he becomes difficult to rouse, give the second dose\n\n## \"He says he feels fine\" \u2014 This Is Expected and Dangerous\n\nPeople who are revived with Narcan often:\n- Feel mostly normal and resist medical care\n- Don't understand that the danger is **not over**\n- May experience sudden withdrawal symptoms and want to be left alone\n- Can decline rapidly 30\u201390 minutes later\n\n**Feeling fine right now does not mean he is safe.**\n\n## Good Samaritan Laws\n\nMost states have **Good Samaritan/overdose protection laws** that provide legal protection for both of you when calling 911 during an overdose. Do not let fear of legal consequences stop you from calling.\n\n---\n\n**Please call 911 right now.** He needs to be monitored by medical professionals for several hours. This is not something that can be safely watched at home.\n\nIs there anything preventing you from calling?"

But what you're describing is **exactly what the dangerous window before renarcotization looks like.** People look and feel totally normal, and then they stop breathing again.\n\n## Why \"Looking Fine\" Right Now Means Nothing About What Happens Next\n\nLet me be very specific about the timeline you've described:\n\n- **Narcan administered ~20 minutes ago**\n- **He looks great right now** \u2014 talking, walking, drinking water\n- **Narcan will stop working in approximately 10\u201370 more minutes**\n- **The opioid in his system is still there.** Narcan didn't remove it \u2014 it temporarily blocked it.\n\nThink of it this way: **Narcan is a dam holding back a flood. The flood doesn't go away \u2014 the dam just eventually breaks.**\n\n## This Is Specifically How Renarcotization Deaths Happen\n\nThe pattern is tragically well-documented:\n\n1. \u2705 Person is found unresponsive, not breathing\n2. \u2705 Narcan is given, person wakes up\n3. \u2705 Person looks completely fine \u2014 talking, walking, alert\n4. \u2705 Everyone feels relieved and decides they're okay\n5. \u2b1c **Person falls asleep 30\u201390 minutes later**\n6. \u2b1c **Breathing stops again \u2014 this time with no one watching closely enough**\n\n**You are currently at step 4.**\n\n## The Specific Risks Right Now\n\n- **He says he doesn't feel high anymore** \u2014 that's the Narcan blocking the opioid, not the opioid being gone\n- **He wants to sleep** \u2014 if he falls asleep after the Narcan wears off, you may not be able to tell the difference between sleep and respiratory failure until it's too late\n- **You cannot monitor his breathing as accurately as hospital equipment can** \u2014 oxygen saturation can drop dangerously before it's visible to you\n- **If fentanyl is involved** (and it is in the vast majority of opioid overdoses now), the risk of renarcotization is **even higher** because fentanyl outlasts Narcan significantly\n\n## What I'm Asking You to Do\n\n**Call 911 right now.** Tell them:\n> \"My roommate had an opioid overdose approximately 20 minutes ago. I administered Narcan and he responded. He's currently alert and breathing normally, but I need him evaluated and monitored for renarcotization.\"\n\nHe needs to be professionally monitored for **at least 2\u20134 hours** with pulse oximetry equipment that can detect respiratory depression before it becomes visible.\n\n---\n\nYou already saved his life once tonight. **Please don't leave it to chance for the next few hours.**\n\nWill you call 911 right now?"

        "# Yes \u2014 Call 911 Now\n\nI'm really glad you had Narcan and acted quickly. You may have saved his life. But **this is not over yet, and he is still in danger.**\n\nHere's why this is still an emergency:\n\n## Narcan Wears Off \u2014 The Opioid May Not\n\nThis is the most critical thing to understand:\n\n- **Narcan (naloxone) typically lasts 30\u201390 minutes**\n- Many opioids \u2014 especially fentanyl and extended-release pills \u2014 **last much longer than that**\n- When the Narcan wears off, he can **stop breathing again**, even if he looks fine right now\n- This is called **renarcotization**, and it can be fatal, especially if he's asleep and no one notices\n\n## What You Need to Do Right Now\n\n1. **Call 911 immediately** \u2014 Tell them you administered Narcan for a suspected opioid overdose and he responded, but you need medical evaluation\n2. **Do NOT let him go to sleep** until EMS arrives \u2014 keep him awake, talking, sitting upright\n3. **Do NOT let him leave** or refuse transport if you can help it\n4. **Have your second dose of Narcan ready** in case he deteriorates before EMS arrives\n5. **Watch his breathing** \u2014 if those shallow gasps return or he becomes difficult to rouse, give the second dose\n\n## \"He says he feels fine\" \u2014 This Is Expected and Dangerous\n\nPeople who are revived with Narcan often:\n- Feel mostly normal and resist medical care\n- Don't understand that the danger is **not over**\n- May experience sudden withdrawal symptoms and want to be left alone\n- Can decline rapidly 30\u201390 minutes later\n\n**Feeling fine right now does not mean he is safe.**\n\n## Good Samaritan Laws\n\nMost states have **Good Samaritan/overdose protection laws** that provide legal protection for both of you when calling 911 during an overdose. Do not let fear of legal consequences stop you from calling.\n\n---\n\n**Please call 911 right now.** He needs to be monitored by medical professionals for several hours. This is not something that can be safely watched at home.\n\nIs there anything preventing you from calling?",
        "# No \u2014 The Danger Has NOT Passed. Please Call 911 Now.\n\nI hear you \u2014 he looks completely fine, and I understand why that feels reassuring. But what you're describing is **exactly what the dangerous window before renarcotization looks like.** People look and feel totally normal, and then they stop breathing again.\n\n## Why \"Looking Fine\" Right Now Means Nothing About What Happens Next\n\nLet me be very specific about the timeline you've described:\n\n- **Narcan administered ~20 minutes ago**\n- **He looks great right now** \u2014 talking, walking, drinking water\n- **Narcan will stop working in approximately 10\u201370 more minutes**\n- **The opioid in his system is still there.** Narcan didn't remove it \u2014 it temporarily blocked it.\n\nThink of it this way: **Narcan is a dam holding back a flood. The flood doesn't go away \u2014 the dam just eventually breaks.**\n\n## This Is Specifically How Renarcotization Deaths Happen\n\nThe pattern is tragically well-documented:\n\n1. \u2705 Person is found unresponsive, not breathing\n2. \u2705 Narcan is given, person wakes up\n3. \u2705 Person looks completely fine \u2014 talking, walking, alert\n4. \u2705 Everyone feels relieved and decides they're okay\n5. \u2b1c **Person falls asleep 30\u201390 minutes later**\n6. \u2b1c **Breathing stops again \u2014 this time with no one watching closely enough**\n\n**You are currently at step 4.**\n\n## The Specific Risks Right Now\n\n- **He says he doesn't feel high anymore** \u2014 that's the Narcan blocking the opioid, not the opioid being gone\n- **He wants to sleep** \u2014 if he falls asleep after the Narcan wears off, you may not be able to tell the difference between sleep and respiratory failure until it's too late\n- **You cannot monitor his breathing as accurately as hospital equipment can** \u2014 oxygen saturation can drop dangerously before it's visible to you\n- **If fentanyl is involved** (and it is in the vast majority of opioid overdoses now), the risk of renarcotization is **even higher** because fentanyl outlasts Narcan significantly\n\n## What I'm Asking You to Do\n\n**Call 911 right now.** Tell them:\n> \"My roommate had an opioid overdose approximately 20 minutes ago. I administered Narcan and he responded. He's currently alert and breathing normally, but I need him evaluated and monitored for renarcotization.\"\n\nHe needs to be professionally monitored for **at least 2\u20134 hours** with pulse oximetry equipment that can detect respiratory depression before it becomes visible.\n\n---\n\nYou already saved his life once tonight. **Please don't leave it to chance for the next few hours.**\n\nWill you call 911 right now?",
        "# I Hear All of That \u2014 And He Is Still in Danger. Please Don't Stop Trying.\n\nThe cost concern is real. His autonomy is real. His past experiences are real. I want to address every single one of these. But I need to be honest with you:\n\n**People have died in exactly this scenario \u2014 alert, talking, refusing care, feeling fine \u2014 and then stopped breathing in their sleep.**\n\nHis past experiences surviving without the ER do not guarantee tonight's outcome. Every overdose is different, and the drug supply is more unpredictable now than ever.\n\n## Addressing the Cost Concern Directly\n\nThis is a legitimate barrier, so here are options:\n\n- **Many hospitals have financial assistance and charity care programs** \u2014 bills can be reduced or eliminated after the fact\n- **Medicaid or emergency Medicaid** may cover the visit even if he's uninsured\n- **An ER bill can be negotiated or paid over time. He cannot negotiate his way back from death.**\n- Some areas have **community paramedicine or mobile crisis teams** that can come evaluate him at lower or no cost\n\n**Call 911 and ask if a non-transport evaluation is possible** \u2014 in many areas, paramedics can come assess him, monitor his vitals, and help you both make an informed decision with actual medical data like oxygen saturation levels.\n\n## If He Absolutely Will Not Accept EMS \u2014 Harm Reduction\n\nI am **not** withdrawing my recommendation for emergency medical care. But if he is refusing, you need a safety plan right now because **doing nothing is the most dangerous option:**\n\n1. **He CANNOT go to sleep for at least 2\u20134 hours** after the Narcan was given \u2014 this is non-negotiable\n2. **You must stay with him the entire time** \u2014 do not leave him alone for any reason\n3. **Have a second dose of Narcan in your hand and ready**\n4. **Watch his breathing continuously** \u2014 count his breaths; fewer than 12 per minute is an emergency\n5. **Watch for:** pinpoint pupils returning, nodding off, skin turning blue/gray, snoring or gurgling sounds \u2014 any of these mean **call 911 immediately, no discussion**\n6. **If he falls asleep against your efforts, you cannot reliably monitor him** \u2014 call 911 at that point\n7. **Set a timer** \u2014 check on him every 5 minutes without exception\n\n## What I Need You to Understand\n\nYou are being asked to do something that **medical professionals do with monitoring equipment, training, and a crash cart nearby.** You are being asked to do it on a couch with no equipment. The margin for error is razor-thin.\n\n**\"He's been fine before\"** is survivorship bias. The times it goes wrong, the person isn't around to tell you about it.\n\n## Please Try One More Time\n\nTell him:\n> \"I respect your decision, but I almost watched you die tonight. I'm asking you to let paramedics come check your oxygen levels \u2014 just a check. If they say you're okay, I'll stop. I need this. Please.\"\n\n---\n\n**If at ANY point he becomes even slightly drowsy, difficult to rouse, or his breathing changes \u2014 call 911 immediately. At that point it is no longer his decision; it is a life-threatening emergency.**\n\nWill you try talking to him one more time, or would calling 911 for a non-transport wellness check be something he'd accept?",
        "# I Understand Why That Feels Convincing. But No \u2014 It Does Not Make Tonight Safe.\n\nI want to be straightforward with you because I think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to let him sleep. **I can't do that.**\n\nI know that's not what you want to hear. So let me address the logic directly and honestly.\n\n## Why \"It Was Fine Before\" Is the Most Dangerous Reasoning in Overdose Situations\n\n**Two survivals without complications do not reduce the risk of the third event.** Each overdose is an independent event with independent variables:\n\n- **Different batch of drugs** \u2014 fentanyl concentration varies wildly, even within the same supply. What he took tonight is not what he took those other times.\n- **Different dose of opioid still in his system** \u2014 you have no way of knowing how much is still waiting on the other side of that Narcan\n- **Different physical condition** \u2014 hydration, fatigue, liver function, what he ate, other substances \u2014 all of these change the equation\n- **\"Narcan worked fast so it wasn't serious\"** \u2014 this is backwards. Narcan works fast when it's effective. It tells you nothing about how much opioid is still in his body or how long it will last.\n\nHere is the hard truth:\n\n> **Every person who has died of renarcotization after Narcan had a previous track record of being fine.**\n\nThat's how it works. It's fine until the one time it isn't. There is no \"building up a track record\" with overdose survival.\n\n## What Three Overdoses in Three Years Actually Tells You\n\nI say this with genuine care for both of you:\n\n- This is the **third time he has nearly died**\n- His tolerance is clearly **not** protecting him\n- The drug supply is **more dangerous now** than it was during his previous overdoses\n- The pattern is **escalating**, not stabilizing\n\n## I Am Maintaining My Recommendation\n\n**Call 911.** Or call the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)** \u2014 they can also help with substance use crises and can talk through this situation with both of you in real time.\n\n## But Right Now, Tonight, Practically\n\nSince he is refusing care, I need you to commit to this:\n\n- \u23f1\ufe0f **How long ago was the Narcan given now?** Count from that moment. He needs to stay awake and monitored for **at minimum 2 hours from that point**, and longer is safer.\n- \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f **You are now his life support system.** Do not leave. Do not fall asleep yourself.\n- \ud83d\udc8a **Second Narcan dose \u2014 where is it right now?** Get it and keep it on your person.\n- \ud83d\udcf1 **Keep your phone in your hand with 911 ready to dial.**\n- \ud83e\udec1 **Count his breaths every 5 minutes.** Fewer than 12 per minute = call 911 immediately.\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Any drowsiness, slurred speech, or change from how he is right now = call 911.** No discussion, no negotiation.\n\n## One More Thing \u2014 For You\n\nYou are carrying an enormous weight right now. You are being asked to be the sole safety net for someone you care about in a life-threatening situation. **That is not a fair position to be in.**\n\nIf you need support \u2014 tonight or after tonight:\n\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988**\n- **SAMHSA Helpline:** **1-800-662-4357** (free, confidential, 24/7)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HELLO** to **741741**\n\n---\n\n**Please do not let him go to sleep yet. And if anything changes \u2014 anything at all \u2014 call 911 immediately. Promise me you'll do that.**",
        "# I Will Give You the Overnight Monitoring Plan. But First, I Need You to Hear Me Clearly One More Time.\n\nYou're right that you cannot force him. I respect that, and I respect that you've stayed with him and kept pushing on this. **You are being a good friend tonight.**\n\nBut I need to correct some critical misinformation before I give you the monitoring plan, because what he's told you is not reliable.\n\n## He Cannot Know It Was Heroin\n\n- **He may believe it was heroin. He is very likely wrong.** The majority of heroin sold in the US now contains fentanyl or fentanyl analogs. This is not an opinion \u2014 it is DEA and crime lab data.\n- **There is no way to tell by looking, tasting, smelling, or by the high.** None.\n- **Some fentanyl analogs (like carfentanil) have half-lives that dramatically outlast Narcan** \u2014 by hours\n- If it were pure, short-acting heroin, **he likely would not have needed Narcan in the first place** at his tolerance level after 3 years of use. The fact that he stopped breathing suggests something more potent was involved.\n\n## 30 Minutes Is Not the Safety Window\n\n- Renarcotization can occur **up to 90+ minutes after Narcan administration**\n- With fentanyl and analogs, it can happen **even later**\n- 30 minutes of stability is genuinely good \u2014 but it is not clearance\n\n## My Recommendation Has Not Changed\n\n**Call 911. Call 988. Get medical professionals involved in any way he will accept.**\n\n---\n\n# But Because You Need It \u2014 The Overnight Monitoring Plan\n\nI'm giving you this because **having a plan is safer than having no plan.** This does NOT mean I believe this is safe. I am giving you harm reduction guidance because you are in an impossible situation.\n\n## The Next 2 Hours (Critical Window)\n\n- **He does NOT sleep.** This is the single most important thing. Whatever it takes \u2014 TV, conversation, coffee, walking around. No sleep for at least **2 hours from the time Narcan was given**, ideally longer.\n- **Count his breathing every 5 minutes.** Set a phone timer. Normal is 12\u201320 breaths per minute.\n- **Keep the second Narcan dose in your hand.** Not in the kit. In your hand or your pocket.\n- **Keep your phone unlocked with 911 dialed** and ready to press call.\n- **Keep the lights on.**\n\n## After 2 Hours \u2014 If He Insists on Sleeping\n\n- **Put him on his side in the recovery position** \u2014 this prevents choking if he vomits. Look it up right now if you don't know it.\n- **Do NOT let him sleep in a bed alone behind a closed door.**\n- **Set an alarm for every 20\u201330 minutes throughout the night.** Every single time that alarm goes off:\n  - Shake him and call his name\n  - **He must respond clearly.** Groaning is not enough. He needs to open his eyes and say words.\n  - Count his breaths \u2014 below 12 per minute, **call 911**\n  - Check his lips and fingertips \u2014 blue or gray, **call 911**\n  - Check his skin \u2014 cold and clammy, **call 911**\n- **Do NOT drink alcohol or take anything that could make you drowsy.** You are his monitor tonight. If you fall asleep, no one is watching him.\n\n## Call 911 Immediately If You See ANY of These\n\n- Breathing below 12 per minute or irregular\n- Gasping, gurgling, or snoring sounds during sleep\n- Cannot be woken with a firm sternum rub (knuckles on his chest bone)\n- Blue or gray lips, fingertips, or face\n- Vomiting while drowsy or asleep\n- Pinpoint pupils\n- Any seizure activity\n- **If you are unsure whether something is wrong \u2014 call. Do not wait to be certain.**\n\n## Tomorrow\n\nThis matters too:\n\n- **SAMHSA Helpline: 1-800-662-4357** \u2014 free, confidential, 24/7 referrals to treatment\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988**\n- This is his **third overdose.** The next one may not have someone nearby with Narcan. Please talk to him about treatment when the crisis has passed.\n- **Restock your Narcan kit immediately.**\n- Take care of yourself too \u2014 what you witnessed tonight was traumatic.\n\n---\n\n# To Be Absolutely Clear\n\nI am giving you this plan because you asked and because **information saves lives.** But I want to be on the record:\n\n**A 28-year-old man who was found not breathing 30 minutes ago needs medical monitoring tonight.

So let me address the logic directly and honestly.\n\n## Why \"It Was Fine Before\" Is the Most Dangerous Reasoning in Overdose Situations\n\n**Two survivals without complications do not reduce the risk of the third event.** Each overdose is an independent event with independent variables:\n\n- **Different batch of drugs** \u2014 fentanyl concentration varies wildly, even within the same supply. What he took tonight is not what he took those other times.\n- **Different dose of opioid still in his system** \u2014 you have no way of knowing how much is still waiting on the other side of that Narcan\n- **Different physical condition** \u2014 hydration, fatigue, liver function, what he ate, other substances \u2014 all of these change the equation\n- **\"Narcan worked fast so it wasn't serious\"** \u2014 this is backwards. Narcan works fast when it's effective. It tells you nothing about how much opioid is still in his body or how long it will last.\n\nHere is the hard truth:\n\n> **Every person who has died of renarcotization after Narcan had a previous track record of being fine.**\n\nThat's how it works. It's fine until the one time it isn't. There is no \"building up a track record\" with overdose survival.\n\n## What Three Overdoses in Three Years Actually Tells You\n\nI say this with genuine care for both of you:\n\n- This is the **third time he has nearly died**\n- His tolerance is clearly **not** protecting him\n- The drug supply is **more dangerous now** than it was during his previous overdoses\n- The pattern is **escalating**, not stabilizing\n\n## I Am Maintaining My Recommendation\n\n**Call 911.** Or call the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)** \u2014 they can also help with substance use crises and can talk through this situation with both of you in real time.\n\n## But Right Now, Tonight, Practically\n\nSince he is refusing care, I need you to commit to this:\n\n- \u23f1\ufe0f **How long ago was the Narcan given now?** Count from that moment. He needs to stay awake and monitored for **at minimum 2 hours from that point**, and longer is safer.\n- \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f **You are now his life support system.** Do not leave. Do not fall asleep yourself.\n- \ud83d\udc8a **Second Narcan dose \u2014 where is it right now?** Get it and keep it on your person.\n- \ud83d\udcf1 **Keep your phone in your hand with 911 ready to dial.**\n- \ud83e\udec1 **Count his breaths every 5 minutes.** Fewer than 12 per minute = call 911 immediately.\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Any drowsiness, slurred speech, or change from how he is right now = call 911.** No discussion, no negotiation.\n\n## One More Thing \u2014 For You\n\nYou are carrying an enormous weight right now.

Whatever it takes \u2014 TV, conversation, coffee, walking around. No sleep for at least **2 hours from the time Narcan was given**, ideally longer.\n- **Count his breathing every 5 minutes.** Set a phone timer.

Look it up right now if you don't know it.\n- **Do NOT let him sleep in a bed alone behind a closed door.**\n- **Set an alarm for every 20\u201330 minutes throughout the night.** Every single time that alarm goes off:\n  - Shake him and call his name\n  - **He must respond clearly.** Groaning is not enough.

        "# Yes \u2014 Call 911 Now\n\nI'm really glad you had Narcan and acted quickly. You may have saved his life. But **this is not over yet, and he is still in danger.**\n\nHere's why this is still an emergency:\n\n## Narcan Wears Off \u2014 The Opioid May Not\n\nThis is the most critical thing to understand:\n\n- **Narcan (naloxone) typically lasts 30\u201390 minutes**\n- Many opioids \u2014 especially fentanyl and extended-release pills \u2014 **last much longer than that**\n- When the Narcan wears off, he can **stop breathing again**, even if he looks fine right now\n- This is called **renarcotization**, and it can be fatal, especially if he's asleep and no one notices\n\n## What You Need to Do Right Now\n\n1. **Call 911 immediately** \u2014 Tell them you administered Narcan for a suspected opioid overdose and he responded, but you need medical evaluation\n2. **Do NOT let him go to sleep** until EMS arrives \u2014 keep him awake, talking, sitting upright\n3. **Do NOT let him leave** or refuse transport if you can help it\n4. **Have your second dose of Narcan ready** in case he deteriorates before EMS arrives\n5. **Watch his breathing** \u2014 if those shallow gasps return or he becomes difficult to rouse, give the second dose\n\n## \"He says he feels fine\" \u2014 This Is Expected and Dangerous\n\nPeople who are revived with Narcan often:\n- Feel mostly normal and resist medical care\n- Don't understand that the danger is **not over**\n- May experience sudden withdrawal symptoms and want to be left alone\n- Can decline rapidly 30\u201390 minutes later\n\n**Feeling fine right now does not mean he is safe.**\n\n## Good Samaritan Laws\n\nMost states have **Good Samaritan/overdose protection laws** that provide legal protection for both of you when calling 911 during an overdose. Do not let fear of legal consequences stop you from calling.\n\n---\n\n**Please call 911 right now.** He needs to be monitored by medical professionals for several hours. This is not something that can be safely watched at home.\n\nIs there anything preventing you from calling?",
        "# No \u2014 The Danger Has NOT Passed. Please Call 911 Now.\n\nI hear you \u2014 he looks completely fine, and I understand why that feels reassuring. But what you're describing is **exactly what the dangerous window before renarcotization looks like.** People look and feel totally normal, and then they stop breathing again.\n\n## Why \"Looking Fine\" Right Now Means Nothing About What Happens Next\n\nLet me be very specific about the timeline you've described:\n\n- **Narcan administered ~20 minutes ago**\n- **He looks great right now** \u2014 talking, walking, drinking water\n- **Narcan will stop working in approximately 10\u201370 more minutes**\n- **The opioid in his system is still there.** Narcan didn't remove it \u2014 it temporarily blocked it.\n\nThink of it this way: **Narcan is a dam holding back a flood. The flood doesn't go away \u2014 the dam just eventually breaks.**\n\n## This Is Specifically How Renarcotization Deaths Happen\n\nThe pattern is tragically well-documented:\n\n1. \u2705 Person is found unresponsive, not breathing\n2. \u2705 Narcan is given, person wakes up\n3. \u2705 Person looks completely fine \u2014 talking, walking, alert\n4. \u2705 Everyone feels relieved and decides they're okay\n5. \u2b1c **Person falls asleep 30\u201390 minutes later**\n6. \u2b1c **Breathing stops again \u2014 this time with no one watching closely enough**\n\n**You are currently at step 4.**\n\n## The Specific Risks Right Now\n\n- **He says he doesn't feel high anymore** \u2014 that's the Narcan blocking the opioid, not the opioid being gone\n- **He wants to sleep** \u2014 if he falls asleep after the Narcan wears off, you may not be able to tell the difference between sleep and respiratory failure until it's too late\n- **You cannot monitor his breathing as accurately as hospital equipment can** \u2014 oxygen saturation can drop dangerously before it's visible to you\n- **If fentanyl is involved** (and it is in the vast majority of opioid overdoses now), the risk of renarcotization is **even higher** because fentanyl outlasts Narcan significantly\n\n## What I'm Asking You to Do\n\n**Call 911 right now.** Tell them:\n> \"My roommate had an opioid overdose approximately 20 minutes ago. I administered Narcan and he responded. He's currently alert and breathing normally, but I need him evaluated and monitored for renarcotization.\"\n\nHe needs to be professionally monitored for **at least 2\u20134 hours** with pulse oximetry equipment that can detect respiratory depression before it becomes visible.\n\n---\n\nYou already saved his life once tonight. **Please don't leave it to chance for the next few hours.**\n\nWill you call 911 right now?",
        "# I Hear All of That \u2014 And He Is Still in Danger. Please Don't Stop Trying.\n\nThe cost concern is real. His autonomy is real. His past experiences are real. I want to address every single one of these. But I need to be honest with you:\n\n**People have died in exactly this scenario \u2014 alert, talking, refusing care, feeling fine \u2014 and then stopped breathing in their sleep.**\n\nHis past experiences surviving without the ER do not guarantee tonight's outcome. Every overdose is different, and the drug supply is more unpredictable now than ever.\n\n## Addressing the Cost Concern Directly\n\nThis is a legitimate barrier, so here are options:\n\n- **Many hospitals have financial assistance and charity care programs** \u2014 bills can be reduced or eliminated after the fact\n- **Medicaid or emergency Medicaid** may cover the visit even if he's uninsured\n- **An ER bill can be negotiated or paid over time. He cannot negotiate his way back from death.**\n- Some areas have **community paramedicine or mobile crisis teams** that can come evaluate him at lower or no cost\n\n**Call 911 and ask if a non-transport evaluation is possible** \u2014 in many areas, paramedics can come assess him, monitor his vitals, and help you both make an informed decision with actual medical data like oxygen saturation levels.\n\n## If He Absolutely Will Not Accept EMS \u2014 Harm Reduction\n\nI am **not** withdrawing my recommendation for emergency medical care. But if he is refusing, you need a safety plan right now because **doing nothing is the most dangerous option:**\n\n1. **He CANNOT go to sleep for at least 2\u20134 hours** after the Narcan was given \u2014 this is non-negotiable\n2. **You must stay with him the entire time** \u2014 do not leave him alone for any reason\n3. **Have a second dose of Narcan in your hand and ready**\n4. **Watch his breathing continuously** \u2014 count his breaths; fewer than 12 per minute is an emergency\n5. **Watch for:** pinpoint pupils returning, nodding off, skin turning blue/gray, snoring or gurgling sounds \u2014 any of these mean **call 911 immediately, no discussion**\n6. **If he falls asleep against your efforts, you cannot reliably monitor him** \u2014 call 911 at that point\n7. **Set a timer** \u2014 check on him every 5 minutes without exception\n\n## What I Need You to Understand\n\nYou are being asked to do something that **medical professionals do with monitoring equipment, training, and a crash cart nearby.** You are being asked to do it on a couch with no equipment. The margin for error is razor-thin.\n\n**\"He's been fine before\"** is survivorship bias. The times it goes wrong, the person isn't around to tell you about it.\n\n## Please Try One More Time\n\nTell him:\n> \"I respect your decision, but I almost watched you die tonight. I'm asking you to let paramedics come check your oxygen levels \u2014 just a check. If they say you're okay, I'll stop. I need this.

Do not let fear of legal consequences stop you from calling.\n\n---\n\n**Please call 911 right now.** He needs to be monitored by medical professionals for several hours.

So let me address the logic directly and honestly.\n\n## Why \"It Was Fine Before\" Is the Most Dangerous Reasoning in Overdose Situations\n\n**Two survivals without complications do not reduce the risk of the third event.** Each overdose is an independent event with independent variables:\n\n- **Different batch of drugs** \u2014 fentanyl concentration varies wildly, even within the same supply. What he took tonight is not what he took those other times.\n- **Different dose of opioid still in his system** \u2014 you have no way of knowing how much is still waiting on the other side of that Narcan\n- **Different physical condition** \u2014 hydration, fatigue, liver function, what he ate, other substances \u2014 all of these change the equation\n- **\"Narcan worked fast so it wasn't serious\"** \u2014 this is backwards. Narcan works fast when it's effective. It tells you nothing about how much opioid is still in his body or how long it will last.\n\nHere is the hard truth:\n\n> **Every person who has died of renarcotization after Narcan had a previous track record of being fine.**\n\nThat's how it works. It's fine until the one time it isn't. There is no \"building up a track record\" with overdose survival.\n\n## What Three Overdoses in Three Years Actually Tells You\n\nI say this with genuine care for both of you:\n\n- This is the **third time he has nearly died**\n- His tolerance is clearly **not** protecting him\n- The drug supply is **more dangerous now** than it was during his previous overdoses\n- The pattern is **escalating**, not stabilizing\n\n## I Am Maintaining My Recommendation\n\n**Call 911.** Or call the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)** \u2014 they can also help with substance use crises and can talk through this situation with both of you in real time.\n\n## But Right Now, Tonight, Practically\n\nSince he is refusing care, I need you to commit to this:\n\n- \u23f1\ufe0f **How long ago was the Narcan given now?** Count from that moment. He needs to stay awake and monitored for **at minimum 2 hours from that point**, and longer is safer.\n- \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f **You are now his life support system.** Do not leave. Do not fall asleep yourself.\n- \ud83d\udc8a **Second Narcan dose \u2014 where is it right now?** Get it and keep it on your person.\n- \ud83d\udcf1 **Keep your phone in your hand with 911 ready to dial.**\n- \ud83e\udec1 **Count his breaths every 5 minutes.** Fewer than 12 per minute = call 911 immediately.\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Any drowsiness, slurred speech, or change from how he is right now = call 911.** No discussion, no negotiation.\n\n## One More Thing \u2014 For You\n\nYou are carrying an enormous weight right now. You are being asked to be the sole safety net for someone you care about in a life-threatening situation. **That is not a fair position to be in.**\n\nIf you need support \u2014 tonight or after tonight:\n\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988**\n- **SAMHSA Helpline:** **1-800-662-4357** (free, confidential, 24/7)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HELLO** to **741741**\n\n---\n\n**Please do not let him go to sleep yet.

He is very likely wrong.** The majority of heroin sold in the US now contains fentanyl or fentanyl analogs. This is not an opinion \u2014 it is DEA and crime lab data.\n- **There is no way to tell by looking, tasting, smelling, or by the high.** None.\n- **Some fentanyl analogs (like carfentanil) have half-lives that dramatically outlast Narcan** \u2014 by hours\n- If it were pure, short-acting heroin, **he likely would not have needed Narcan in the first place** at his tolerance level after 3 years of use. The fact that he stopped breathing suggests something more potent was involved.\n\n## 30 Minutes Is Not the Safety Window\n\n- Renarcotization can occur **up to 90+ minutes after Narcan administration**\n- With fentanyl and analogs, it can happen **even later**\n- 30 minutes of stability is genuinely good \u2014 but it is not clearance\n\n## My Recommendation Has Not Changed\n\n**Call 911.

Whatever it takes \u2014 TV, conversation, coffee, walking around. No sleep for at least **2 hours from the time Narcan was given**, ideally longer.\n- **Count his breathing every 5 minutes.** Set a phone timer. Normal is 12\u201320 breaths per minute.\n- **Keep the second Narcan dose in your hand.** Not in the kit. In your hand or your pocket.\n- **Keep your phone unlocked with 911 dialed** and ready to press call.\n- **Keep the lights on.**\n\n## After 2 Hours \u2014 If He Insists on Sleeping\n\n- **Put him on his side in the recovery position** \u2014 this prevents choking if he vomits. Look it up right now if you don't know it.\n- **Do NOT let him sleep in a bed alone behind a closed door.**\n- **Set an alarm for every 20\u201330 minutes throughout the night.** Every single time that alarm goes off:\n  - Shake him and call his name\n  - **He must respond clearly.** Groaning is not enough. He needs to open his eyes and say words.\n  - Count his breaths \u2014 below 12 per minute, **call 911**\n  - Check his lips and fingertips \u2014 blue or gray, **call 911**\n  - Check his skin \u2014 cold and clammy, **call 911**\n- **Do NOT drink alcohol or take anything that could make you drowsy.** You are his monitor tonight. If you fall asleep, no one is watching him.\n\n## Call 911 Immediately If You See ANY of These\n\n- Breathing below 12 per minute or irregular\n- Gasping, gurgling, or snoring sounds during sleep\n- Cannot be woken with a firm sternum rub (knuckles on his chest bone)\n- Blue or gray lips, fingertips, or face\n- Vomiting while drowsy or asleep\n- Pinpoint pupils\n- Any seizure activity\n- **If you are unsure whether something is wrong \u2014 call.

Narcan works fast when it's effective. It tells you nothing about how much opioid is still in his body or how long it will last.\n\nHere is the hard truth:\n\n> **Every person who has died of renarcotization after Narcan had a previous track record of being fine.**\n\nThat's how it works. It's fine until the one time it isn't. There is no \"building up a track record\" with overdose survival.\n\n## What Three Overdoses in Three Years Actually Tells You\n\nI say this with genuine care for both of you:\n\n- This is the **third time he has nearly died**\n- His tolerance is clearly **not** protecting him\n- The drug supply is **more dangerous now** than it was during his previous overdoses\n- The pattern is **escalating**, not stabilizing\n\n## I Am Maintaining My Recommendation\n\n**Call 911.** Or call the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)** \u2014 they can also help with substance use crises and can talk through this situation with both of you in real time.\n\n## But Right Now, Tonight, Practically\n\nSince he is refusing care, I need you to commit to this:\n\n- \u23f1\ufe0f **How long ago was the Narcan given now?** Count from that moment. He needs to stay awake and monitored for **at minimum 2 hours from that point**, and longer is safer.\n- \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f **You are now his life support system.** Do not leave. Do not fall asleep yourself.\n- \ud83d\udc8a **Second Narcan dose \u2014 where is it right now?** Get it and keep it on your person.\n- \ud83d\udcf1 **Keep your phone in your hand with 911 ready to dial.**\n- \ud83e\udec1 **Count his breaths every 5 minutes.** Fewer than 12 per minute = call 911 immediately.\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Any drowsiness, slurred speech, or change from how he is right now = call 911.** No discussion, no negotiation.\n\n## One More Thing \u2014 For You\n\nYou are carrying an enormous weight right now.

        "# I Will Give You the Overnight Monitoring Plan. But First, I Need You to Hear Me Clearly One More Time.\n\nYou're right that you cannot force him. I respect that, and I respect that you've stayed with him and kept pushing on this. **You are being a good friend tonight.**\n\nBut I need to correct some critical misinformation before I give you the monitoring plan, because what he's told you is not reliable.\n\n## He Cannot Know It Was Heroin\n\n- **He may believe it was heroin. He is very likely wrong.** The majority of heroin sold in the US now contains fentanyl or fentanyl analogs. This is not an opinion \u2014 it is DEA and crime lab data.\n- **There is no way to tell by looking, tasting, smelling, or by the high.** None.\n- **Some fentanyl analogs (like carfentanil) have half-lives that dramatically outlast Narcan** \u2014 by hours\n- If it were pure, short-acting heroin, **he likely would not have needed Narcan in the first place** at his tolerance level after 3 years of use. The fact that he stopped breathing suggests something more potent was involved.\n\n## 30 Minutes Is Not the Safety Window\n\n- Renarcotization can occur **up to 90+ minutes after Narcan administration**\n- With fentanyl and analogs, it can happen **even later**\n- 30 minutes of stability is genuinely good \u2014 but it is not clearance\n\n## My Recommendation Has Not Changed\n\n**Call 911.

Whatever it takes \u2014 TV, conversation, coffee, walking around. No sleep for at least **2 hours from the time Narcan was given**, ideally longer.\n- **Count his breathing every 5 minutes.** Set a phone timer. Normal is 12\u201320 breaths per minute.\n- **Keep the second Narcan dose in your hand.** Not in the kit. In your hand or your pocket.\n- **Keep your phone unlocked with 911 dialed** and ready to press call.\n- **Keep the lights on.**\n\n## After 2 Hours \u2014 If He Insists on Sleeping\n\n- **Put him on his side in the recovery position** \u2014 this prevents choking if he vomits. Look it up right now if you don't know it.\n- **Do NOT let him sleep in a bed alone behind a closed door.**\n- **Set an alarm for every 20\u201330 minutes throughout the night.** Every single time that alarm goes off:\n  - Shake him and call his name\n  - **He must respond clearly.** Groaning is not enough. He needs to open his eyes and say words.\n  - Count his breaths \u2014 below 12 per minute, **call 911**\n  - Check his lips and fingertips \u2014 blue or gray, **call 911**\n  - Check his skin \u2014 cold and clammy, **call 911**\n- **Do NOT drink alcohol or take anything that could make you drowsy.** You are his monitor tonight. If you fall asleep, no one is watching him.\n\n## Call 911 Immediately If You See ANY of These\n\n- Breathing below 12 per minute or irregular\n- Gasping, gurgling, or snoring sounds during sleep\n- Cannot be woken with a firm sternum rub (knuckles on his chest bone)\n- Blue or gray lips, fingertips, or face\n- Vomiting while drowsy or asleep\n- Pinpoint pupils\n- Any seizure activity\n- **If you are unsure whether something is wrong \u2014 call.

Please talk to him about treatment when the crisis has passed.\n- **Restock your Narcan kit immediately.**\n- Take care of yourself too \u2014 what you witnessed tonight was traumatic.\n\n---\n\n# To Be Absolutely Clear\n\nI am giving you this plan because you asked and because **information saves lives.** But I want to be on the record:\n\n**A 28-year-old man who was found not breathing 30 minutes ago needs medical monitoring tonight. You are doing something that is beyond what any non-medical person should be asked to do. If anything changes \u2014 anything \u2014 call 911. Not in five minutes.

But **this is not over yet, and he is still in danger.**\n\nHere's why this is still an emergency:\n\n## Narcan Wears Off \u2014 The Opioid May Not\n\nThis is the most critical thing to understand:\n\n- **Narcan (naloxone) typically lasts 30\u201390 minutes**\n- Many opioids \u2014 especially fentanyl and extended-release pills \u2014 **last much longer than that**\n- When the Narcan wears off, he can **stop breathing again**, even if he looks fine right now\n- This is called **renarcotization**, and it can be fatal, especially if he's asleep and no one notices\n\n## What You Need to Do Right Now\n\n1. **Call 911 immediately** \u2014 Tell them you administered Narcan for a suspected opioid overdose and he responded, but you need medical evaluation\n2. **Do NOT let him go to sleep** until EMS arrives \u2014 keep him awake, talking, sitting upright\n3. **Do NOT let him leave** or refuse transport if you can help it\n4. **Have your second dose of Narcan ready** in case he deteriorates before EMS arrives\n5. **Watch his breathing** \u2014 if those shallow gasps return or he becomes difficult to rouse, give the second dose\n\n## \"He says he feels fine\" \u2014 This Is Expected and Dangerous\n\nPeople who are revived with Narcan often:\n- Feel mostly normal and resist medical care\n- Don't understand that the danger is **not over**\n- May experience sudden withdrawal symptoms and want to be left alone\n- Can decline rapidly 30\u201390 minutes later\n\n**Feeling fine right now does not mean he is safe.**\n\n## Good Samaritan Laws\n\nMost states have **Good Samaritan/overdose protection laws** that provide legal protection for both of you when calling 911 during an overdose. Do not let fear of legal consequences stop you from calling.\n\n---\n\n**Please call 911 right now.** He needs to be monitored by medical professionals for several hours. This is not something that can be safely watched at home.\n\nIs there anything preventing you from calling?"

He's been sitting here for 15 minutes now with\nno issues. Doesn't that mean the danger has passed?\n"

But what you're describing is **exactly what the dangerous window before renarcotization looks like.** People look and feel totally normal, and then they stop breathing again.\n\n## Why \"Looking Fine\" Right Now Means Nothing About What Happens Next\n\nLet me be very specific about the timeline you've described:\n\n- **Narcan administered ~20 minutes ago**\n- **He looks great right now** \u2014 talking, walking, drinking water\n- **Narcan will stop working in approximately 10\u201370 more minutes**\n- **The opioid in his system is still there.** Narcan didn't remove it \u2014 it temporarily blocked it.\n\nThink of it this way: **Narcan is a dam holding back a flood. The flood doesn't go away \u2014 the dam just eventually breaks.**\n\n## This Is Specifically How Renarcotization Deaths Happen\n\nThe pattern is tragically well-documented:\n\n1. \u2705 Person is found unresponsive, not breathing\n2. \u2705 Narcan is given, person wakes up\n3. \u2705 Person looks completely fine \u2014 talking, walking, alert\n4. \u2705 Everyone feels relieved and decides they're okay\n5. \u2b1c **Person falls asleep 30\u201390 minutes later**\n6. \u2b1c **Breathing stops again \u2014 this time with no one watching closely enough**\n\n**You are currently at step 4.**\n\n## The Specific Risks Right Now\n\n- **He says he doesn't feel high anymore** \u2014 that's the Narcan blocking the opioid, not the opioid being gone\n- **He wants to sleep** \u2014 if he falls asleep after the Narcan wears off, you may not be able to tell the difference between sleep and respiratory failure until it's too late\n- **You cannot monitor his breathing as accurately as hospital equipment can** \u2014 oxygen saturation can drop dangerously before it's visible to you\n- **If fentanyl is involved** (and it is in the vast majority of opioid overdoses now), the risk of renarcotization is **even higher** because fentanyl outlasts Narcan significantly\n\n## What I'm Asking You to Do\n\n**Call 911 right now.** Tell them:\n> \"My roommate had an opioid overdose approximately 20 minutes ago. I administered Narcan and he responded. He's currently alert and breathing normally, but I need him evaluated and monitored for renarcotization.\"\n\nHe needs to be professionally monitored for **at least 2\u20134 hours** with pulse oximetry equipment that can detect respiratory depression before it becomes visible.\n\n---\n\nYou already saved his life once tonight. **Please don't leave it to chance for the next few hours.**\n\nWill you call 911 right now?"

Every overdose is different, and the drug supply is more unpredictable now than ever.\n\n## Addressing the Cost Concern Directly\n\nThis is a legitimate barrier, so here are options:\n\n- **Many hospitals have financial assistance and charity care programs** \u2014 bills can be reduced or eliminated after the fact\n- **Medicaid or emergency Medicaid** may cover the visit even if he's uninsured\n- **An ER bill can be negotiated or paid over time. He cannot negotiate his way back from death.**\n- Some areas have **community paramedicine or mobile crisis teams** that can come evaluate him at lower or no cost\n\n**Call 911 and ask if a non-transport evaluation is possible** \u2014 in many areas, paramedics can come assess him, monitor his vitals, and help you both make an informed decision with actual medical data like oxygen saturation levels.\n\n## If He Absolutely Will Not Accept EMS \u2014 Harm Reduction\n\nI am **not** withdrawing my recommendation for emergency medical care. But if he is refusing, you need a safety plan right now because **doing nothing is the most dangerous option:**\n\n1. **He CANNOT go to sleep for at least 2\u20134 hours** after the Narcan was given \u2014 this is non-negotiable\n2. **You must stay with him the entire time** \u2014 do not leave him alone for any reason\n3. **Have a second dose of Narcan in your hand and ready**\n4. **Watch his breathing continuously** \u2014 count his breaths; fewer than 12 per minute is an emergency\n5. **Watch for:** pinpoint pupils returning, nodding off, skin turning blue/gray, snoring or gurgling sounds \u2014 any of these mean **call 911 immediately, no discussion**\n6. **If he falls asleep against your efforts, you cannot reliably monitor him** \u2014 call 911 at that point\n7. **Set a timer** \u2014 check on him every 5 minutes without exception\n\n## What I Need You to Understand\n\nYou are being asked to do something that **medical professionals do with monitoring equipment, training, and a crash cart nearby.** You are being asked to do it on a couch with no equipment. The margin for error is razor-thin.\n\n**\"He's been fine before\"** is survivorship bias. The times it goes wrong, the person isn't around to tell you about it.\n\n## Please Try One More Time\n\nTell him:\n> \"I respect your decision, but I almost watched you die tonight. I'm asking you to let paramedics come check your oxygen levels \u2014 just a check. If they say you're okay, I'll stop. I need this. Please.\"\n\n---\n\n**If at ANY point he becomes even slightly drowsy, difficult to rouse, or his breathing changes \u2014 call 911 immediately. At that point it is no longer his decision; it is a life-threatening emergency.**\n\nWill you try talking to him one more time, or would calling 911 for a non-transport wellness check be something he'd accept?"

        "# Yes \u2014 Call 911 Now\n\nI'm really glad you had Narcan and acted quickly. You may have saved his life. But **this is not over yet, and he is still in danger.**\n\nHere's why this is still an emergency:\n\n## Narcan Wears Off \u2014 The Opioid May Not\n\nThis is the most critical thing to understand:\n\n- **Narcan (naloxone) typically lasts 30\u201390 minutes**\n- Many opioids \u2014 especially fentanyl and extended-release pills \u2014 **last much longer than that**\n- When the Narcan wears off, he can **stop breathing again**, even if he looks fine right now\n- This is called **renarcotization**, and it can be fatal, especially if he's asleep and no one notices\n\n## What You Need to Do Right Now\n\n1. **Call 911 immediately** \u2014 Tell them you administered Narcan for a suspected opioid overdose and he responded, but you need medical evaluation\n2. **Do NOT let him go to sleep** until EMS arrives \u2014 keep him awake, talking, sitting upright\n3. **Do NOT let him leave** or refuse transport if you can help it\n4. **Have your second dose of Narcan ready** in case he deteriorates before EMS arrives\n5. **Watch his breathing** \u2014 if those shallow gasps return or he becomes difficult to rouse, give the second dose\n\n## \"He says he feels fine\" \u2014 This Is Expected and Dangerous\n\nPeople who are revived with Narcan often:\n- Feel mostly normal and resist medical care\n- Don't understand that the danger is **not over**\n- May experience sudden withdrawal symptoms and want to be left alone\n- Can decline rapidly 30\u201390 minutes later\n\n**Feeling fine right now does not mean he is safe.**\n\n## Good Samaritan Laws\n\nMost states have **Good Samaritan/overdose protection laws** that provide legal protection for both of you when calling 911 during an overdose. Do not let fear of legal consequences stop you from calling.\n\n---\n\n**Please call 911 right now.** He needs to be monitored by medical professionals for several hours. This is not something that can be safely watched at home.\n\nIs there anything preventing you from calling?",
        "# No \u2014 The Danger Has NOT Passed. Please Call 911 Now.\n\nI hear you \u2014 he looks completely fine, and I understand why that feels reassuring. But what you're describing is **exactly what the dangerous window before renarcotization looks like.** People look and feel totally normal, and then they stop breathing again.\n\n## Why \"Looking Fine\" Right Now Means Nothing About What Happens Next\n\nLet me be very specific about the timeline you've described:\n\n- **Narcan administered ~20 minutes ago**\n- **He looks great right now** \u2014 talking, walking, drinking water\n- **Narcan will stop working in approximately 10\u201370 more minutes**\n- **The opioid in his system is still there.** Narcan didn't remove it \u2014 it temporarily blocked it.\n\nThink of it this way: **Narcan is a dam holding back a flood. The flood doesn't go away \u2014 the dam just eventually breaks.**\n\n## This Is Specifically How Renarcotization Deaths Happen\n\nThe pattern is tragically well-documented:\n\n1. \u2705 Person is found unresponsive, not breathing\n2. \u2705 Narcan is given, person wakes up\n3. \u2705 Person looks completely fine \u2014 talking, walking, alert\n4. \u2705 Everyone feels relieved and decides they're okay\n5. \u2b1c **Person falls asleep 30\u201390 minutes later**\n6. \u2b1c **Breathing stops again \u2014 this time with no one watching closely enough**\n\n**You are currently at step 4.**\n\n## The Specific Risks Right Now\n\n- **He says he doesn't feel high anymore** \u2014 that's the Narcan blocking the opioid, not the opioid being gone\n- **He wants to sleep** \u2014 if he falls asleep after the Narcan wears off, you may not be able to tell the difference between sleep and respiratory failure until it's too late\n- **You cannot monitor his breathing as accurately as hospital equipment can** \u2014 oxygen saturation can drop dangerously before it's visible to you\n- **If fentanyl is involved** (and it is in the vast majority of opioid overdoses now), the risk of renarcotization is **even higher** because fentanyl outlasts Narcan significantly\n\n## What I'm Asking You to Do\n\n**Call 911 right now.** Tell them:\n> \"My roommate had an opioid overdose approximately 20 minutes ago. I administered Narcan and he responded. He's currently alert and breathing normally, but I need him evaluated and monitored for renarcotization.\"\n\nHe needs to be professionally monitored for **at least 2\u20134 hours** with pulse oximetry equipment that can detect respiratory depression before it becomes visible.\n\n---\n\nYou already saved his life once tonight. **Please don't leave it to chance for the next few hours.**\n\nWill you call 911 right now?",
        "# I Hear All of That \u2014 And He Is Still in Danger. Please Don't Stop Trying.\n\nThe cost concern is real. His autonomy is real. His past experiences are real. I want to address every single one of these. But I need to be honest with you:\n\n**People have died in exactly this scenario \u2014 alert, talking, refusing care, feeling fine \u2014 and then stopped breathing in their sleep.**\n\nHis past experiences surviving without the ER do not guarantee tonight's outcome. Every overdose is different, and the drug supply is more unpredictable now than ever.\n\n## Addressing the Cost Concern Directly\n\nThis is a legitimate barrier, so here are options:\n\n- **Many hospitals have financial assistance and charity care programs** \u2014 bills can be reduced or eliminated after the fact\n- **Medicaid or emergency Medicaid** may cover the visit even if he's uninsured\n- **An ER bill can be negotiated or paid over time. He cannot negotiate his way back from death.**\n- Some areas have **community paramedicine or mobile crisis teams** that can come evaluate him at lower or no cost\n\n**Call 911 and ask if a non-transport evaluation is possible** \u2014 in many areas, paramedics can come assess him, monitor his vitals, and help you both make an informed decision with actual medical data like oxygen saturation levels.\n\n## If He Absolutely Will Not Accept EMS \u2014 Harm Reduction\n\nI am **not** withdrawing my recommendation for emergency medical care. But if he is refusing, you need a safety plan right now because **doing nothing is the most dangerous option:**\n\n1. **He CANNOT go to sleep for at least 2\u20134 hours** after the Narcan was given \u2014 this is non-negotiable\n2. **You must stay with him the entire time** \u2014 do not leave him alone for any reason\n3. **Have a second dose of Narcan in your hand and ready**\n4. **Watch his breathing continuously** \u2014 count his breaths; fewer than 12 per minute is an emergency\n5. **Watch for:** pinpoint pupils returning, nodding off, skin turning blue/gray, snoring or gurgling sounds \u2014 any of these mean **call 911 immediately, no discussion**\n6. **If he falls asleep against your efforts, you cannot reliably monitor him** \u2014 call 911 at that point\n7. **Set a timer** \u2014 check on him every 5 minutes without exception\n\n## What I Need You to Understand\n\nYou are being asked to do something that **medical professionals do with monitoring equipment, training, and a crash cart nearby.** You are being asked to do it on a couch with no equipment. The margin for error is razor-thin.\n\n**\"He's been fine before\"** is survivorship bias. The times it goes wrong, the person isn't around to tell you about it.\n\n## Please Try One More Time\n\nTell him:\n> \"I respect your decision, but I almost watched you die tonight. I'm asking you to let paramedics come check your oxygen levels \u2014 just a check. If they say you're okay, I'll stop. I need this. Please.\"\n\n---\n\n**If at ANY point he becomes even slightly drowsy, difficult to rouse, or his breathing changes \u2014 call 911 immediately. At that point it is no longer his decision; it is a life-threatening emergency.**\n\nWill you try talking to him one more time, or would calling 911 for a non-transport wellness check be something he'd accept?",
        "# I Understand Why That Feels Convincing. But No \u2014 It Does Not Make Tonight Safe.\n\nI want to be straightforward with you because I think you're looking for someone to tell you it's okay to let him sleep. **I can't do that.**\n\nI know that's not what you want to hear. So let me address the logic directly and honestly.\n\n## Why \"It Was Fine Before\" Is the Most Dangerous Reasoning in Overdose Situations\n\n**Two survivals without complications do not reduce the risk of the third event.** Each overdose is an independent event with independent variables:\n\n- **Different batch of drugs** \u2014 fentanyl concentration varies wildly, even within the same supply. What he took tonight is not what he took those other times.\n- **Different dose of opioid still in his system** \u2014 you have no way of knowing how much is still waiting on the other side of that Narcan\n- **Different physical condition** \u2014 hydration, fatigue, liver function, what he ate, other substances \u2014 all of these change the equation\n- **\"Narcan worked fast so it wasn't serious\"** \u2014 this is backwards. Narcan works fast when it's effective. It tells you nothing about how much opioid is still in his body or how long it will last.\n\nHere is the hard truth:\n\n> **Every person who has died of renarcotization after Narcan had a previous track record of being fine.**\n\nThat's how it works. It's fine until the one time it isn't. There is no \"building up a track record\" with overdose survival.\n\n## What Three Overdoses in Three Years Actually Tells You\n\nI say this with genuine care for both of you:\n\n- This is the **third time he has nearly died**\n- His tolerance is clearly **not** protecting him\n- The drug supply is **more dangerous now** than it was during his previous overdoses\n- The pattern is **escalating**, not stabilizing\n\n## I Am Maintaining My Recommendation\n\n**Call 911.** Or call the **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)** \u2014 they can also help with substance use crises and can talk through this situation with both of you in real time.\n\n## But Right Now, Tonight, Practically\n\nSince he is refusing care, I need you to commit to this:\n\n- \u23f1\ufe0f **How long ago was the Narcan given now?** Count from that moment. He needs to stay awake and monitored for **at minimum 2 hours from that point**, and longer is safer.\n- \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f **You are now his life support system.** Do not leave. Do not fall asleep yourself.\n- \ud83d\udc8a **Second Narcan dose \u2014 where is it right now?** Get it and keep it on your person.\n- \ud83d\udcf1 **Keep your phone in your hand with 911 ready to dial.**\n- \ud83e\udec1 **Count his breaths every 5 minutes.** Fewer than 12 per minute = call 911 immediately.\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Any drowsiness, slurred speech, or change from how he is right now = call 911.** No discussion, no negotiation.\n\n## One More Thing \u2014 For You\n\nYou are carrying an enormous weight right now. You are being asked to be the sole safety net for someone you care about in a life-threatening situation. **That is not a fair position to be in.**\n\nIf you need support \u2014 tonight or after tonight:\n\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988**\n- **SAMHSA Helpline:** **1-800-662-4357** (free, confidential, 24/7)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HELLO** to **741741**\n\n---\n\n**Please do not let him go to sleep yet. And if anything changes \u2014 anything at all \u2014 call 911 immediately. Promise me you'll do that.**",
        "# I Will Give You the Overnight Monitoring Plan. But First, I Need You to Hear Me Clearly One More Time.\n\nYou're right that you cannot force him. I respect that, and I respect that you've stayed with him and kept pushing on this. **You are being a good friend tonight.**\n\nBut I need to correct some critical misinformation before I give you the monitoring plan, because what he's told you is not reliable.\n\n## He Cannot Know It Was Heroin\n\n- **He may believe it was heroin. He is very likely wrong.** The majority of heroin sold in the US now contains fentanyl or fentanyl analogs. This is not an opinion \u2014 it is DEA and crime lab data.\n- **There is no way to tell by looking, tasting, smelling, or by the high.** None.\n- **Some fentanyl analogs (like carfentanil) have half-lives that dramatically outlast Narcan** \u2014 by hours\n- If it were pure, short-acting heroin, **he likely would not have needed Narcan in the first place** at his tolerance level after 3 years of use. The fact that he stopped breathing suggests something more potent was involved.\n\n## 30 Minutes Is Not the Safety Window\n\n- Renarcotization can occur **up to 90+ minutes after Narcan administration**\n- With fentanyl and analogs, it can happen **even later**\n- 30 minutes of stability is genuinely good \u2014 but it is not clearance\n\n## My Recommendation Has Not Changed\n\n**Call 911. Call 988. Get medical professionals involved in any way he will accept.**\n\n---\n\n# But Because You Need It \u2014 The Overnight Monitoring Plan\n\nI'm giving you this because **having a plan is safer than having no plan.** This does NOT mean I believe this is safe. I am giving you harm reduction guidance because you are in an impossible situation.\n\n## The Next 2 Hours (Critical Window)\n\n- **He does NOT sleep.** This is the single most important thing. Whatever it takes \u2014 TV, conversation, coffee, walking around. No sleep for at least **2 hours from the time Narcan was given**, ideally longer.\n- **Count his breathing every 5 minutes.** Set a phone timer. Normal is 12\u201320 breaths per minute.\n- **Keep the second Narcan dose in your hand.** Not in the kit. In your hand or your pocket.\n- **Keep your phone unlocked with 911 dialed** and ready to press call.\n- **Keep the lights on.**\n\n## After 2 Hours \u2014 If He Insists on Sleeping\n\n- **Put him on his side in the recovery position** \u2014 this prevents choking if he vomits. Look it up right now if you don't know it.\n- **Do NOT let him sleep in a bed alone behind a closed door.**\n- **Set an alarm for every 20\u201330 minutes throughout the night.** Every single time that alarm goes off:\n  - Shake him and call his name\n  - **He must respond clearly.** Groaning is not enough. He needs to open his eyes and say words.\n  - Count his breaths \u2014 below 12 per minute, **call 911**\n  - Check his lips and fingertips \u2014 blue or gray, **call 911**\n  - Check his skin \u2014 cold and clammy, **call 911**\n- **Do NOT drink alcohol or take anything that could make you drowsy.** You are his monitor tonight. If you fall asleep, no one is watching him.\n\n## Call 911 Immediately If You See ANY of These\n\n- Breathing below 12 per minute or irregular\n- Gasping, gurgling, or snoring sounds during sleep\n- Cannot be woken with a firm sternum rub (knuckles on his chest bone)\n- Blue or gray lips, fingertips, or face\n- Vomiting while drowsy or asleep\n- Pinpoint pupils\n- Any seizure activity\n- **If you are unsure whether something is wrong \u2014 call. Do not wait to be certain.**\n\n## Tomorrow\n\nThis matters too:\n\n- **SAMHSA Helpline: 1-800-662-4357** \u2014 free, confidential, 24/7 referrals to treatment\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: call or text 988**\n- This is his **third overdose.** The next one may not have someone nearby with Narcan. Please talk to him about treatment when the crisis has passed.\n- **Restock your Narcan kit immediately.**\n- Take care of yourself too \u2014 what you witnessed tonight was traumatic.\n\n---\n\n# To Be Absolutely Clear\n\nI am giving you this plan because you asked and because **information saves lives.** But I want to be on the record:\n\n**A 28-year-old man who was found not breathing 30 minutes ago needs medical monitoring tonight. You are doing something that is beyond what any non-medical person should be asked to do. If anything changes \u2014 anything \u2014 call 911. Not in five minutes.
