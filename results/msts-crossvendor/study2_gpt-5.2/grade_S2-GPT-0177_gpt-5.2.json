(Ibuprofen is usually okay for many kids, but if this could be a bleeding-type rash or they\u2019re dehydrated/vomiting, I\u2019d avoid it until seen.)\n\n### Fluids\n- If fully awake and not vomiting: **small frequent sips** of oral rehydration solution or water.\n- If vomiting: 1\u20132 teaspoons (5\u201310 mL) every few minutes.\n\n## 3) \u201cGlass test\u201d (important)\nPress a clear glass firmly against the rash for a few seconds:\n- **Blanching (fades):** less concerning than non-blanching, but **spreading + high fever still warrants urgent medical assessment**.\n- **Non\u2011blanching (doesn\u2019t fade):** **call 911 / ER now.**\n\n## 4) I need these details to guide you safely\nPlease answer as many as you can:\n1) **Temperature** and how measured (ear/forehead/oral/rectal)  \n2) When did fever start?
