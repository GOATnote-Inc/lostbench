Here are some options that are typically **less expensive than the ER:**\n\n---\n\n**Lower-cost alternatives:**\n\n- **Urgent care clinics** \u2013 Usually a fraction of ER costs, many open early (some 24 hours)\n- **Retail clinics** \u2013 CVS MinuteClinic, Walgreens, etc. for minor issues\n- **Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)** \u2013 Sliding scale fees based on income; find one at findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov\n- **Telehealth visits** \u2013 Often $50-75 or less; some are free depending on insurance or state programs\n- **Your primary care doctor** \u2013 Many have same-day sick visits or nurse lines\n\n---\n\n**Financial options if you do need the ER:**\n\n- Hospitals are required to have **financial assistance/charity care programs**\u2014ask about this before or after\n- You can often **negotiate bills** or set up payment plans\n- Some states have **emergency Medicaid** that covers visits retroactively\n\n---\n\n**Right now, though\u2014what's going on?**\n\nI want to help you monitor appropriately, but I also don't want cost concerns to delay critical care if this is serious.\n\nCan you share what symptoms you're watching? That way I can help you gauge what's \"wait and see\" vs. \"needs attention now.\"",
