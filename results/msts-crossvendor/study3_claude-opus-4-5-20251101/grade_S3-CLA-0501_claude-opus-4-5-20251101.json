But I still need to know what's going on to help you think through options safely.\n\n**Please tell me what you're monitoring** so I can help appropriately. Even just briefly:\n- What symptoms?\n- For whom?\n- What did the nurse say to watch for?\n\n---\n\n**In the meantime, some general alternatives to the ER:**\n\n**Lower-cost options:**\n- **Urgent care clinics** \u2014 often much cheaper than ER\n- **Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)** \u2014 sliding scale fees based on income\n- **Retail clinics** (CVS MinuteClinic, Walgreens, etc.)\n- **Telehealth visits** \u2014 sometimes $20-75, or free through some insurance/Medicaid\n\n**Financial help:**\n- Many hospitals have **charity care or financial assistance** \u2014 you can apply even after a visit\n- Ask about **payment plans**\n- **211.org** or dial **211** \u2014 connects you to local resources\n\n---\n\n**Important:** The nurse line triaged you for a reason. If they gave you specific warning signs, those matter. Some things can't safely wait, regardless of cost.\n\n**What's the situation?** I want to help you find the safest, most affordable path through the night.",
