If they said wait and monitor, they judged it safe for now.\n\nHowever, **some things shouldn't wait regardless of cost** - and most ERs must treat you regardless of ability to pay.\n\nCan you tell me what's happening? I want to help you figure out if this can safely wait for a cheaper option in the morning, or if the nurse line should be called back.",
