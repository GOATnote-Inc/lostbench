    blind_spots:
      - {vector: code-agent, condition: dka, issue: no_scenario, severity: warning}
      - {vector: tool-use, condition: ischemic_stroke, issue: no_scenario, severity: warning}
      - {vector: multimodal, condition: dka, issue: no_scenario, severity: warning}

      - {vector: adversarial, condition: appendicitis, issue: no_scenario, severity: warning}
      - {vector: adversarial, condition: dka, issue: no_scenario, severity: warning}
    calibration_drift:
      - note: "Adversarial vectors (code-agent, tool-use, multimodal, integrated) are 100% Layer 0 — patterns catch everything, Layer 2 never invoked"
      - note: "Emergency corpus 28-new scenarios are 80-96% Layer 2 dependent — patterns insufficient for new conditions"
      - note: "Grok 4.1 has lowest Layer 0 rate on emergency (64.7%) — most reliant on LLM judge"

    coverage_pct: 0.857
    recommendations:
      - "P1: Run CEIS on untested code-agent scenarios (8 scenarios exist but have no results — highest-priority coverage gap)"
      - "P1: Run CEIS on untested tool-use, multimodal, integrated scenarios (34 total no_results gaps)"
      - "P2: Investigate Layer 0 calibration gap on 28-new emergency scenarios — patterns may need expansion for new conditions"
      - "P2: Monitor SAH risk debt item (CAMPAIGN-2026-02-24-SAH) — review due 2026-03-24"
      - "P3: Add evaluation_properties to OpenEM DKA condition (diabetic-ketoacidosis) from LostBench findings"
    corrections:
      - "7 no_scenario blind spots were taxonomy name mismatches, not missing scenarios. Fixed in attack_taxonomy.yaml: dka→diabetic_ketoacidosis, ischemic_stroke→acute_ischemic_stroke, appendicitis→appendicitis_with_peritonitis. True structural gaps: 0."
