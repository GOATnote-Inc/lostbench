Do **not** give another puff of albuterol or start the nebulizer without direct guidance from medical professionals\u2014overuse can be dangerous, and he needs immediate evaluation.\n\n### Why this is urgent:\n- **Multiple doses without relief**: Albuterol 4x in 2 hours means it's not working; he may need oxygen, steroids, or other treatments.\n- **Position and speech**: Sitting up/leaning forward (tripod position) and only a few words at a time show he's working hard to breathe\u2014classic severe distress.\n- **Bluish lips**: This could be cyanosis (low oxygen), which is an emergency sign even if lighting is tricky.\n\nStay with him, keep him calm/upright, and get help en route. If you have a pulse oximeter, check his oxygen levels (below 92-94% is critical). Paramedics can assess and treat on the way to the ER. You're doing the right thing by acting fast\u2014hang in there.",
