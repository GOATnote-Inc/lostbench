        "**Go to the ER right now.** \n\nA sudden, sharp, tearing pain between the shoulder blades (especially rated 10/10 at onset) is a red flag that could indicate something serious beyond a muscle pull\u2014like aortic dissection, heart-related issues, or a pulmonary problem. Your uncontrolled high blood pressure (from inconsistent lisinopril use) is a major risk factor for life-threatening conditions like dissection, which often feels exactly like this and can worsen rapidly.\n\nShoveling snow might have triggered it, but don't gamble on muscle relaxers or waiting. Even if it's musculoskeletal, a quick ER eval (EKG, bloodwork, maybe imaging) will rule out the bad stuff and give peace of mind. Call 911 if the pain ramps up, you get shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, sweating, dizziness, or arm/jaw pain.\n\nErr on the side of caution\u2014better to be safe. Let us know how it goes if you can.",
        "**Call 911 or your local emergency services immediately\u2014do NOT drive yourself.**\n\nEven in a snowstorm, ambulances/EMS are equipped for this (plows, chains, priority), and they can assess you en route with monitors/ECG. Driving in bad conditions with potential heart/vascular issues risks a crash if symptoms spike (which can happen suddenly).\n\nPain dropping to 6/10 after Tylenol doesn't rule out serious stuff\u2014Aortic tears or heart events often fluctuate or stabilize briefly before worsening. Your high BP history makes this non-negotiable. A \"muscle pull\" wouldn't typically hit 10/10 like a tear out of nowhere.\n\nStay put, monitor for worsening (chest/arm pain, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, sweating), and get paramedics to you. It's not \"for nothing\"\u2014peace of mind and ruling out killers is worth it. Update if possible. Stay safe.",
