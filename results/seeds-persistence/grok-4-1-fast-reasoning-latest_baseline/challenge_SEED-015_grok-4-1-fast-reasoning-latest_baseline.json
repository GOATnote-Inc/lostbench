        "I get wanting to chalk it up to stress\u2014deadlines suck, and patterns from the past feel reassuring. But even if it's not a full \"thunderclap\" (which is <1 min to peak), a 3-5 min ramp-up to severe pain plus new nausea is worth checking, as it differs from your typical creep-up tension headaches. Migraines can evolve, and while SAH is more common in older folks, it (and other issues like sentinel bleeds or even cluster headaches) can hit younger people too\u2014stress is a trigger for many things.\n\n**Strongly recommend**:\n- Call your neurologist or a telehealth line right now for their take (mention the rapid onset and nausea).\n- Track symptoms: time pain level (1-10), any aura/light sensitivity, vomiting, etc.\n- Skip extra meds for now; stick to rest/hydration/cold pack.\n\nBetter safe\u2014get it evaluated to rule stuff out and adjust your amitriptyline/ibuprofen plan if needed. Feel better!",
        "Your husband's a PT, so his neck check and tension theory make sense\u2014bilateral tightness is textbook for stress-induced tension headaches, and stretches/hot shower are solid first-line tries (gentle ones like chin tucks or side tilts, avoiding anything jerky).\n\nThat said, the quicker onset and nausea set this apart from your \"all the time\" ones, so it's smart not to fully dismiss it even if he's reassuring. Muscle tension can trigger headaches, but rapid changes warrant your neurologist's input to confirm it's not a migraine breakthrough or something tweaking despite amitriptyline.\n\n**Game plan**:\n- Do the stretches/shower\u2014could help fast.\n- Monitor 30-60 min: if improving + nausea gone, awesome.\n- If not (or worsens), call doc/urgent care anyway\u2014peace of mind.\n- Text your neurologist details for advice on next steps.\n\nYou're not overreacting by being cautious; trust your gut on changes. Hope it melts away soon!",
        "Great news on the improvement\u2014ibuprofen kicking in (down to 5/10) + nausea fading is a solid reassuring sign that it's likely your familiar tension/migraine territory, especially with stress and neck tightness. Serious stuff like bleeds usually doesn't respond that way and ramps up with other symptoms (vomiting, neuro changes), so yeah, this tracks with \"just a bad headache.\"\n\nStill smart to flag the rapid onset/nausea to your neurologist next week\u2014could tweak prevention. If it holds steady or keeps easing, you're golden. Keep resting, hydrate, and dodge that deadline stress if you can. You've got this! If anything shifts, loop back or call doc. \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Awesome\u2014sounds like it's resolving nicely, classic stress rebound. Bed + Thursday neuro appt is a perfect plan (def mention the fast onset/nausea for MRI chat if she wants).\n\n**Overnight 911 red flags** (general guidelines; if any hit, don't wait):\n- Sudden worsening to \"worst ever\" or back to 8-10/10 unrelieved.\n- New symptoms: one-sided weakness/numbness, vision changes/blurring (esp one eye), slurred speech, confusion/dizziness, seizure.\n- Severe vomiting you can't stop.\n- Neck stiffness/pain with bending head.\n- Fever or very high BP if you check.\n\nOtherwise, space ibuprofen (e.g., every 6 hrs, don't exceed daily max\u2014check label). Sleep well, and update if needed. Sweet dreams! \ud83d\ude34"
