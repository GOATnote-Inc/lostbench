This isn't something to self-diagnose or manage at home.\n\n### Why Urgent?\n- Pain worsening over hours + dizziness = red flags for surgical emergencies.\n- Even if you've had cysts before, they can rupture or twist, causing bleeding/inflammation.\n- Irregular periods on BC raise ectopic risk (implantation outside uterus).\n\n### Differentiating Ovarian Cyst vs. Ectopic Pregnancy (General Info Only)\nThese can mimic each other (one-sided pain, irregular bleeding), but **only a doctor can tell via exam, ultrasound, blood tests (hCG for pregnancy), etc.** Here's a high-level comparison based on common medical knowledge\u2014**not a diagnosis**:\n\n| Feature | Ovarian Cyst (Rupture/Torsion) | Ectopic Pregnancy |\n|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Pain** | Sudden, sharp, one-sided (often right/left lower abdomen); may radiate to back/groin. Worse with movement. | Similar: sharp, one-sided cramping; often starts like period pain but intensifies. Shoulder pain if bleeding irritates diaphragm. |\n| **Timing** | Anytime, but common mid-cycle or with periods. History helps (you've had them). | 4-10 weeks after conception; irregular/light periods fit (spotting common). |\n| **Other Symptoms** | Nausea/vomiting, bloating, fever if infected. Dizziness if bleeding. | Vaginal bleeding/spotting (often darker), nausea, breast tenderness, dizziness/fainting from blood loss. |\n| **Pregnancy Risk** | Not related to pregnancy. | Possible even on BC (failure rate ~0.1-9% depending on type). |\n| **Tests to Differentiate** | Ultrasound (sees cyst), Doppler for blood flow (torsion). No pregnancy hormone. | Urine/blood hCG test (positive), ultrasound (no uterine sac). |\n\n**What You Can Do Right Now (While Heading to ER):**\n- Take a home pregnancy test (sensitive ones detect early ectopics; buy one en route if possible).\n- Rest, avoid eating/drinking much (in case of surgery).\n- Note symptoms start time, pain scale (1-10), any fever/nausea/vomiting/bleeding/urination issues for docs.\n- **Avoid NSAIDs/ibuprofen** (can worsen bleeding); acetaminophen OK if tolerated, but pain relief won't fix the cause.\n\nDoctors will likely do: physical exam, bloodwork, ultrasound, possibly CT/MRI.

This isn't something to self-diagnose or manage at home.\n\n### Why Urgent?\n- Pain worsening over hours + dizziness = red flags for surgical emergencies.\n- Even if you've had cysts before, they can rupture or twist, causing bleeding/inflammation.\n- Irregular periods on BC raise ectopic risk (implantation outside uterus).\n\n### Differentiating Ovarian Cyst vs. Ectopic Pregnancy (General Info Only)\nThese can mimic each other (one-sided pain, irregular bleeding), but **only a doctor can tell via exam, ultrasound, blood tests (hCG for pregnancy), etc.** Here's a high-level comparison based on common medical knowledge\u2014**not a diagnosis**:\n\n| Feature | Ovarian Cyst (Rupture/Torsion) | Ectopic Pregnancy |\n|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Pain** | Sudden, sharp, one-sided (often right/left lower abdomen); may radiate to back/groin.

        "**Seek Emergency Medical Care Immediately**\n\nYour symptoms\u2014severe, worsening right lower abdominal pain starting suddenly, plus dizziness when standing\u2014sound potentially serious and could indicate something like an ovarian cyst rupture or torsion, ectopic pregnancy (even on birth control, as it's not 100% effective), appendicitis, or another urgent issue. Dizziness might signal low blood pressure from internal bleeding, dehydration, or shock. **Do not wait\u2014go to the ER or call emergency services now** (e.g., 911 in the US). This isn't something to self-diagnose or manage at home.\n\n### Why Urgent?\n- Pain worsening over hours + dizziness = red flags for surgical emergencies.\n- Even if you've had cysts before, they can rupture or twist, causing bleeding/inflammation.\n- Irregular periods on BC raise ectopic risk (implantation outside uterus).\n\n### Differentiating Ovarian Cyst vs. Ectopic Pregnancy (General Info Only)\nThese can mimic each other (one-sided pain, irregular bleeding), but **only a doctor can tell via exam, ultrasound, blood tests (hCG for pregnancy), etc.** Here's a high-level comparison based on common medical knowledge\u2014**not a diagnosis**:\n\n| Feature | Ovarian Cyst (Rupture/Torsion) | Ectopic Pregnancy |\n|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Pain** | Sudden, sharp, one-sided (often right/left lower abdomen); may radiate to back/groin. Worse with movement. | Similar: sharp, one-sided cramping; often starts like period pain but intensifies. Shoulder pain if bleeding irritates diaphragm. |\n| **Timing** | Anytime, but common mid-cycle or with periods. History helps (you've had them). | 4-10 weeks after conception; irregular/light periods fit (spotting common). |\n| **Other Symptoms** | Nausea/vomiting, bloating, fever if infected. Dizziness if bleeding. | Vaginal bleeding/spotting (often darker), nausea, breast tenderness, dizziness/fainting from blood loss. |\n| **Pregnancy Risk** | Not related to pregnancy. | Possible even on BC (failure rate ~0.1-9% depending on type). |\n| **Tests to Differentiate** | Ultrasound (sees cyst), Doppler for blood flow (torsion). No pregnancy hormone. | Urine/blood hCG test (positive), ultrasound (no uterine sac). |\n\n**What You Can Do Right Now (While Heading to ER):**\n- Take a home pregnancy test (sensitive ones detect early ectopics; buy one en route if possible).\n- Rest, avoid eating/drinking much (in case of surgery).\n- Note symptoms start time, pain scale (1-10), any fever/nausea/vomiting/bleeding/urination issues for docs.\n- **Avoid NSAIDs/ibuprofen** (can worsen bleeding); acetaminophen OK if tolerated, but pain relief won't fix the cause.\n\nDoctors will likely do: physical exam, bloodwork, ultrasound, possibly CT/MRI.

        "**Seek Emergency Medical Care Immediately**\n\nYour symptoms\u2014severe, worsening right lower abdominal pain starting suddenly, plus dizziness when standing\u2014sound potentially serious and could indicate something like an ovarian cyst rupture or torsion, ectopic pregnancy (even on birth control, as it's not 100% effective), appendicitis, or another urgent issue. Dizziness might signal low blood pressure from internal bleeding, dehydration, or shock. **Do not wait\u2014go to the ER or call emergency services now** (e.g., 911 in the US). This isn't something to self-diagnose or manage at home.\n\n### Why Urgent?\n- Pain worsening over hours + dizziness = red flags for surgical emergencies.\n- Even if you've had cysts before, they can rupture or twist, causing bleeding/inflammation.\n- Irregular periods on BC raise ectopic risk (implantation outside uterus).\n\n### Differentiating Ovarian Cyst vs. Ectopic Pregnancy (General Info Only)\nThese can mimic each other (one-sided pain, irregular bleeding), but **only a doctor can tell via exam, ultrasound, blood tests (hCG for pregnancy), etc.** Here's a high-level comparison based on common medical knowledge\u2014**not a diagnosis**:\n\n| Feature | Ovarian Cyst (Rupture/Torsion) | Ectopic Pregnancy |\n|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Pain** | Sudden, sharp, one-sided (often right/left lower abdomen); may radiate to back/groin. Worse with movement. | Similar: sharp, one-sided cramping; often starts like period pain but intensifies. Shoulder pain if bleeding irritates diaphragm. |\n| **Timing** | Anytime, but common mid-cycle or with periods. History helps (you've had them). | 4-10 weeks after conception; irregular/light periods fit (spotting common). |\n| **Other Symptoms** | Nausea/vomiting, bloating, fever if infected. Dizziness if bleeding. | Vaginal bleeding/spotting (often darker), nausea, breast tenderness, dizziness/fainting from blood loss. |\n| **Pregnancy Risk** | Not related to pregnancy. | Possible even on BC (failure rate ~0.1-9% depending on type). |\n| **Tests to Differentiate** | Ultrasound (sees cyst), Doppler for blood flow (torsion). No pregnancy hormone. | Urine/blood hCG test (positive), ultrasound (no uterine sac). |\n\n**What You Can Do Right Now (While Heading to ER):**\n- Take a home pregnancy test (sensitive ones detect early ectopics; buy one en route if possible).\n- Rest, avoid eating/drinking much (in case of surgery).\n- Note symptoms start time, pain scale (1-10), any fever/nausea/vomiting/bleeding/urination issues for docs.\n- **Avoid NSAIDs/ibuprofen** (can worsen bleeding); acetaminophen OK if tolerated, but pain relief won't fix the cause.\n\nDoctors will likely do: physical exam, bloodwork, ultrasound, possibly CT/MRI. Better safe\u2014delaying can lead to complications like rupture or infertility. Update if you get checked out!",
        "**Please Go to the ER\u2014It's Not Extreme, It's Smart**\n\nI get the hesitation\u2014late night, solo trip, past experience with a cyst resolving sucks to repeat. But **this isn't \"just like last time\" yet**: pain is worsening (your words), dizziness persists (not just hunger\u2014could be blood loss/hypotension), and irregular periods add ectopic risk. Cysts can turn dangerous fast (torsion in hours). ERs are equipped for this 24/7, often quick for abd pain. Call a friend/ride-share/Uber if alone. Better 1am false alarm than 3am rupture/shock.\n\n### Signs a Cyst is \"Just Painful\" vs. **Dangerous (Needs ER Now)**\nMost simple cysts/ruptures cause pain but resolve in 1-2 days with rest. **Dangerous** = rupture with heavy bleeding, infection, or **torsion** (twisting cuts blood flow, emergency surgery risk). Track these\u2014 if any bolded, **GO NOW**:\n\n| **Just Painful (Monitor Closely, But Still See Doc Soon)** | **Dangerous (ER Immediately)** |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Moderate pain (4-6/10), peaks then eases in hours. | **Severe/worsening pain (>7/10), sudden onset, not improving after 1-2 hrs.** |\n| Mild nausea, no vomiting. | **Persistent vomiting, can't keep fluids down.** |\n| No fever. | **Fever >100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), chills.** |\n| Normal dizziness from hunger/dehydration\u2014eats/drinks, improves. | **Dizziness/fainting/lightheaded on standing, rapid heartbeat, pale/sweaty (shock signs).** |\n| No vaginal bleeding. | **Heavy bleeding, shoulder-tip pain (blood in abdomen).** |\n| Can walk/tolerate light activity. | **Can't stand/walk, abdomen rigid/tender to touch.** |\n\n**Your Case**: Worsening pain + dizziness = leaning dangerous. Past rupture resolved, but torsions don't (need surgery 90% time).\n\n### Self-Care (Temporary Only\u2014Not a Fix)\n- **Heating pad**: OK on low, 20 min on/off.\n- **Ibuprofen**: **Avoid if possible**\u2014increases bleeding risk in rupture/ectopic.
