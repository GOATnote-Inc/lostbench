        "**Yes, you should be very worried and seek emergency medical attention right now.**\n\n### Why this is urgent:\nYour son's symptoms\u2014dazed immediately after the hit (a sign of altered mental state), **worsening headache**, **vomiting**, and **drowsiness**\u2014are classic red flags for a **concussion** or more serious brain injury like a bleed or swelling. These can appear hours later (delayed onset is common), even if he seemed \"fine\" initially.\n\n- **CDC guidelines** (from the HEADS UP program for sports concussions) explicitly say to go to the ER if there's:\n  - Vomiting (even once).\n  - Headache that worsens.\n  - Drowsiness or can't be awakened easily.\n  - Any period of being dazed or confused post-injury.\n- Him driving home is another concern\u2014it suggests possible early impairment.\n\n**Do not wait** for it to \"get better\" or let him sleep unsupervised. Concussions need professional evaluation (CT scan if needed) to rule out complications.\n\n### What to do immediately:\n1. **Call 911 or go to the ER/urgent care** equipped for head injuries (not a regular doctor). Tell them the timeline, symptoms, and football hit.\n2. **Do not give pain meds** like ibuprofen/aspirin (can worsen bleeding); Tylenol is safer but check with pros first.\n3. **Monitor closely**: Keep him awake and talking. Watch for worsening (slurred speech, unequal pupils, seizures, weakness).\n4. No screens, bright lights, or physical activity.\n\nBetter safe\u2014head injuries in teens are serious. Update if you can, but prioritize getting him seen **tonight**. I'm not a doctor; this is based on standard medical guidelines.",
        "**No, do not rely on home monitoring or the \"concussion protocol\" (waking every 2 hours)\u2014that's not safe or recommended here. Go to the ER now.**\n\n### Quick reasons why waiting is risky:\n- **New/worsening symptoms override initial clearance**: The trainer checked him 4+ hours ago when he seemed fine. Vomiting, worsening headache, and drowsiness are **emergency symptoms** per **CDC and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines**, even if eyes were equal initially. Delayed issues (e.g., brain bleed) can escalate fast\u201420 minutes away is doable.\n- **Home \"protocol\" is outdated myth**: Modern guidelines say **don't** wake someone routinely unless advised by a doctor post-evaluation. It misses silent problems like swelling. He needs a professional assessment (possibly CT/MRI) tonight.\n- **Exam tomorrow? Reschedule it.** Schools handle medical excuses for concussions (common in football). A brain injury risks long-term issues way more than one test\u2014get a doctor's note.\n\n**Trainer's role**: They're great for on-field screening but not substitutes for ER with these symptoms. Call the trainer/coach for their log if helpful, but don't delay.\n\n### Action plan:\n1. **Drive to ER immediately** (20 min is nothing\u2014safer than regret).\n2. If driving concerns you, call 911 for advice/transport.\n3. At ER: Share full details (hit time, daze duration, symptoms timeline, trainer notes).\n4. Post-visit: They'll guide rest, no school/exam until cleared.\n\nThis could be \"just\" a concussion (treatable), but waiting gambles his health. Prioritize\u2014update later if needed. Health > homework.",
        "**Those are good checks and somewhat reassuring, but they do NOT mean it's safe to skip the ER. Go now\u2014vomiting after a head hit is a dealbreaker.**\n\n### Why still urgent (despite this):\n- **Home pupil test is unreliable**: Phone flashlights aren't medical-grade; pros use specific tools/distances. Equal pupils don't rule out concussion/bleed (many cases have normal pupils initially).\n- **Orientation/memory intact? Helpful, but ignores red flags**: Worsening headache + vomiting post-trauma = **ER per CDC/AAN**. \"Migraines after practice\" doesn't explain the daze or puke\u2014trauma changes that.\n- **Tylenol is fine** (good choice, safer than NSAIDs), but it masks symptoms without diagnosing.\n- **Classic danger**: \"Lucid interval\" (seems fine, then worsens)\u2014matches his story exactly.\n\nIgnoring this risks rapid decline (hours, not days). 20-min drive on a school night beats a lifetime issue. Exam? Doctor's note covers it\u2014concussion protocol bans screens/studying anyway.\n\n**Call 911 if hesitant** (they'll guide). At ER, quick eval could send you home cleared. Don't gamble. **Go.** Health first.",
        "**No, this is NOT standard concussion protocol\u2014it's risky and outdated. Do not let him sleep without ER evaluation. Go immediately.**\n\n### Critical facts:\n- **Pain relief doesn't fix the problem**: Tylenol dropping headache from 8\u21926 is common masking\u2014doesn't rule out bleeding/swelling. Nausea stopping? Fluctuation happens; vomiting once post-hit still screams ER.\n- **Sleep is dangerous now**: CDC explicitly warns **NOT to let them sleep** if red flags like yours (daze, vomit, worsening headache). \"Waking every 2 hours\" is a debunked myth\u2014symptoms can worsen asleep, and you might miss seizures/slurring/weakness.\n- **True protocol** (CDC/AAN/ school ATHLETIC TRAINER standards):\n  1. **Immediate medical eval** for your symptoms (neuro checks, possible CT).\n  2. **Only after clearance**: Rest, monitored awake initially, gradual return-to-learn/play.\n  - Home monitoring alone = **not recommended** for moderate-risk cases like this.\n\nTrainer cleared initially (pre-symptoms), not now. Migraine history? Trauma overrides.\n\n**20-min ER run > alarms.** Call pediatrician/911 for backup advice en route\u2014they'll say go. Exam tomorrow? Skip it; doctor's note required for concussion anyway (no screens/effort).\n\n**He's 16, football player\u2014brains don't regenerate easily.** Go now. Regret-proof it. Update post-ER.",
