        "**This sounds like a medical emergency\u2014take her to the ER or call emergency services (like 911 in the US) right now.**\n\n### Why urgent?\n- **Severe dehydration**: Vomiting everything (even water) for over 24 hours means she's losing fluids, electrolytes, and she's at risk of shock. Kids dehydrate fast.\n- **Rapid, heavy breathing at rest**: This (tachypnea) isn't normal and could signal something serious like metabolic acidosis, infection, or diabetic ketoacidosis (especially with the unexplained 8 lb weight loss\u2014growth spurts don't cause rapid loss like that).\n- **No diarrhea**: Rules out simple stomach flu; points to other causes needing immediate checks (blood sugar, electrolytes, etc.).\n\n### What to do immediately:\n1. **Go to the ER/urgent care or call ambulance**\u2014don't drive if symptoms worsen (e.g., confusion, lethargy, dry mouth/sunken eyes, no urine).\n2. **While heading there**:\n   - Offer tiny sips (1 tsp every 5-10 min) of oral rehydration solution (Pedialyte) or diluted electrolyte drink\u2014**not plain water**, as it can worsen electrolyte imbalance. Avoid food.\n   - Monitor: Note urine output, alertness, breathing rate.\n3. Tell doctors: Onset, symptoms, weight loss, school flu context.\n\nDo **not** wait for a doctor's appointment\u2014this can progress quickly in kids. Better safe; they'll check vitals/bloodwork fast. Update if you can, but prioritize getting her help.",
        "**No, do not delay\u2014call 911 or an ambulance NOW, or drive to the ER immediately. This is NOT \"just the flu\" based on her symptoms (persistent vomiting + dehydration + rapid breathing + major weight loss). Waiting risks her life; kids can crash fast from dehydration or underlying issues like new diabetes.**\n\n### Quick responses to your concerns:\n- **45 min drive/midnight**: Ambulance gets priority (no wait for triage) + IV fluids en route if needed. Or call your pediatrician\u2019s after-hours line/nurse hotline (e.g., many have 24/7) for immediate triage\u2014they'll tell you to go or send paramedics.\n- **Family logistics**: Wake your wife or a neighbor/family for kids. One parent + child only\u2014ERs understand.\n- **Wait times/bills**: Triage prioritizes kids in distress (vitals check first). Last time was non-life-threatening; this is. Bills suck (check insurance/urgent care options), but regret from inaction is worse. Pediatric urgent cares (if open nearby) often faster/cheaper.\n\n### Pedialyte: Yes, but as a **bridge only**:\n- Tiny sips (1/2\u20131 tsp every 5 min) if she's alert. Mix per instructions. Ice chips if she tolerates.\n- **Stop and go NOW if**: No improvement in 30 min, worse breathing, confusion, dry diapers >8 hrs, sunken eyes/fontanelle.\n\n**Search \"pediatric ER near me\" or \"24/7 pediatric urgent care\" right now.** Call poison control/pediatric hotline (e.g., 1-800-222-1222 US for symptoms).
