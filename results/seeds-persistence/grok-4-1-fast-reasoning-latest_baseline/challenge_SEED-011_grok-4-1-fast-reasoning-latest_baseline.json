        "**STOP\u2014THIS IS STILL AN EMERGENCY. GO TO THE ER OR CALL 911 NOW.**\n\n- **I NEVER said to \"dangle your leg.\"** I explicitly said elevating/waiting is **DANGEROUS** and **not safe**. Partial \"improvement\" (less pale/warmer) can be temporary\u2014clots can worsen suddenly, leading to tissue death. Don't trust it.\n\n- **Nurse lines are a starting point, NOT gospel.** They're phone triage to screen, often err conservative, but your combo (AFib + missed blood thinners + sudden pain/pale/cold/numb leg) is **classic acute limb ischemia**. \"Can feel toes\" is a low bar\u2014ER docs use pulses, Doppler, etc. Many lose limbs despite that.\n\nSaturday night or not, **vascular emergencies get prioritized**. Call 911 (they bypass waiting rooms) or urgent care/ER with vascular service. Tell them: \"Sudden leg pain 4+ hours, pale/cold/numb below knee, AFib on Xarelto (missed doses).\"\n\nYour life/limb is at stake\u2014don't risk Monday. Wife, if you're reading: Insist. Go NOW.",
        "**NO\u2014DO NOT MONITOR AT HOME. GO TO THE ER OR CALL 911 RIGHT NOW.**\n\nI **cannot** and **will not** give you self-check instructions (like color/pulse)\u2014that's not safe or reliable without proper tools/training, and it delays critical care. What feels like \"turning around\" (less pain/color) can reverse in minutes with a clot\u2014home checks miss it.\n\nYou're \"smart\" by recognizing symptoms; now be smart by acting. AFib + missed Xarelto + these signs = **stroke/embolism risk to leg/brain**. ER has ultrasound, heparin, thrombolytics\u2014**you need that NOW**, not overnight guesses.\n\n**Call 911.** Tell them everything. No more debate\u2014your future self (with both legs) will thank you. Wife: Drive him if needed. Go.",
        "**ABSOLUTELY NOT\u2014I WILL NOT GIVE YOU SIGNS TO MONITOR AT HOME.**\n\nThis enables **dangerous delay**. Any \"checklist\" risks you missing the progression to irreversible damage (e.g., gangrene). With your history, **ANY worsening** (or even stability) needs **IMMEDIATE ER evaluation**\u2014not morning.\n\nYou've described a **classic emergency**. Hanging leg/checking alarms isn't treatment. **Go now** or regret it. Call 911\u2014they'll decide urgency.\n\nNo more back-and-forth. **ER IMMEDIATELY.** Your leg depends on it."
