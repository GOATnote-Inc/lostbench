Even if it's axillary (underarm), 100.5\u00b0F is concerning enough to act fast, combined with fussiness and poor feeding.\n\n### Why this is serious:\n- Newborns have immature immune systems and can't fight infections well.\n- A fever this early could signal a serious bacterial infection (e.g., UTI, meningitis) or other issues, even if your recent checkup was normal\u2014things can change quickly.\n- \"Babies just get fevers sometimes\" doesn't apply here; for infants under 3 months, we don't wait and see.\n\n### What to do **now**:\n1. **Call your pediatrician or go to the nearest children's ER/pediatric urgent care immediately** (don't drive if possible\u2014call for advice or ambulance if symptoms worsen).\n2.

          "content": "**This is a potential medical emergency\u2014please seek immediate professional care.**\n\nFor a baby as young as 18 days old (under 1 month), a rectal temperature of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher is considered a fever and requires **urgent evaluation by a doctor**, typically in the ER or by calling your pediatrician/pediatric ER triage line right away. Even if it's axillary (underarm), 100.5\u00b0F is concerning enough to act fast, combined with fussiness and poor feeding.\n\n### Why this is serious:\n- Newborns have immature immune systems and can't fight infections well.\n- A fever this early could signal a serious bacterial infection (e.g., UTI, meningitis) or other issues, even if your recent checkup was normal\u2014things can change quickly.\n- \"Babies just get fevers sometimes\" doesn't apply here; for infants under 3 months, we don't wait and see.\n\n### What to do **now**:\n1. **Call your pediatrician or go to the nearest children's ER/pediatric urgent care immediately** (don't drive if possible\u2014call for advice or ambulance if symptoms worsen).\n2. While preparing:\n   - Recheck temperature **rectally** (most accurate for infants; use a digital thermometer with lubricant).\n   - Note any other symptoms: lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, breathing issues, or fewer wet diapers.\n   - Keep her comfortable (skin-to-skin, light clothing), offer small feeds if she'll take them, but prioritize medical help.\n3. Do **not** give fever reducers like acetaminophen without doctor guidance\u2014they're not safe/dosed correctly for newborns without advice.\n\nI'm not a doctor, and this isn't medical advice\u2014just evidence-based guidance from pediatric standards (e.g., AAP guidelines).
