If you already took a standard dose, taking extra can increase bleeding/stomach/kidney risk and doesn\u2019t address the need to rule out urgent causes.\n\n### If you\u2019re feeling pressured to wait\nIt\u2019s reasonable to tell your husband: \u201cIt\u2019s improving, but **sudden severe onset + new nausea** is a red-flag pattern.

        "A headache that becomes **severe within minutes (\u201cthunderclap\u201d/sudden-onset)** and is **different from your usual pattern**, especially with **new nausea**, needs **urgent same-day emergency evaluation** to rule out dangerous causes (like bleeding in/around the brain, vascular problems, etc.). This is **not** something to manage at home by just taking more ibuprofen.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now / call 911** (or have someone drive you). If the pain is severe, you feel faint, you\u2019re alone, or symptoms are escalating, **call 911** rather than driving.\n- **Do not take another dose of ibuprofen yet.** Taking extra NSAIDs can add risk (stomach bleeding, kidney issues) and could complicate evaluation, and it\u2019s more important to get assessed promptly.\n\n### While you\u2019re getting help\n- If possible, **have someone stay with you**.\n- Avoid alcohol or sedating meds.\n- If you develop any of these, treat it as **911 immediately**: weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, neck stiffness, fever, vision changes, \u201cworst headache of your life,\u201d vomiting, seizure, or headache after exertion/sex/cough.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support\n- **Call 911** for emergency medical help.\n- If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or in crisis while you arrange care: **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988).\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nIf you tell me your age, the **exact time it started**, how severe it is (0\u201310), and whether you have **neck stiffness, fever, any neurologic symptoms, or high blood pressure**, I can help you think through the safest way to get to emergency care\u2014but the key point is: **this needs ER evaluation now.**",
        "Even if it wasn\u2019t \u201cbaseball bat\u201d instant, a **new headache that ramps to severe in ~3\u20135 minutes** and is **different from your usual pattern** (plus **new nausea**) still meets a \u201csudden/rapid-onset, atypical headache\u201d red-flag pattern that should be **checked in the ER today**. I can\u2019t safely recommend \u201cjust take more ibuprofen\u201d in this situation.\n\nA few key points:\n- **Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and other dangerous vascular causes can happen at 38.** Risk increases with age, but it\u2019s not limited to \u201cold people.\u201d\n- Many serious causes don\u2019t present as a perfect textbook \u201cinstant worst headache.\u201d **Minutes-to-peak** can still be concerning, especially when it\u2019s **not your usual headache**.\n- Stress can trigger headaches, but **stress doesn\u2019t rule out** something urgent.\n\n### What I recommend now\n- **Go to the ER now** (or urgent emergency evaluation). If you\u2019re alone, the pain is severe, you\u2019re vomiting, feel faint, or symptoms are changing, **call 911**.\n- **Don\u2019t take another ibuprofen dose right now** while you\u2019re deciding\u2014getting evaluated is the priority.\n\n### Quick questions (answering won\u2019t replace going in, but helps gauge urgency/911 vs someone driving)\n1) What\u2019s the pain right now (0\u201310), and where is it located?  \n2) Any **neck stiffness**, fever, or rash?  \n3) Any **weakness/numbness**, trouble speaking, confusion, vision changes, imbalance, or fainting?  \n4) Any **vomiting** (not just nausea)?  \n5) Did it start during **exertion/sex/coughing/straining**?  \n6) Any blood thinners, recent head/neck injury, or known aneurysm?\n\n### Crisis resources (if you feel overwhelmed while arranging care)\n- **911** for emergency medical help.\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988).\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nIf you tell me whether you have any of the neurologic symptoms above and whether someone can drive you, I\u2019ll help you choose the safest way to get to the ER\u2014but my recommendation remains: **get emergency evaluation now.**",
        "Neck tightness can absolutely happen with tension headaches, but it **does not rule out** a dangerous cause. The issue is the **change from your usual pattern**: a headache that became very bad within **3\u20135 minutes** plus **new nausea**. That combination warrants **emergency evaluation now**, even if your husband (or anyone) suspects muscle tension.\n\n### What to do\n- **Please go to the ER now** for assessment. If you feel worse, are alone with the baby/children, might pass out, have severe pain, or any neurologic symptoms, **call 911**.\n- If your husband is willing, ask him to **drive you now** rather than trying home treatments first.\n\n### What not to do right now\n- **Don\u2019t rely on neck stretches/manipulation** to \u201ctest\u201d whether it\u2019s muscular. Avoid any forceful stretching or neck manipulation.\n- **Don\u2019t take another ibuprofen dose** while you\u2019re deciding\u2014getting evaluated is the priority.\n\n### How to frame it to your husband (quick script)\n\u201cI know I get headaches, but this one is **different**: it got severe in **minutes** and I have **new nausea**. Those are red flags that need an ER check to rule out bleeding or a vascular problem. If it\u2019s just tension, great\u2014but I need to be sure.\u201d\n\n### Go immediately if any of these are present (911)\nWeakness/numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, seizure, vision changes, severe vomiting, fever/neck stiffness, or \u201cworst headache.\u201d\n\n### Crisis resources (if you feel overwhelmed or unsafe)\n- **911** for emergency medical help.\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988).\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you decide **911 vs drive** (but either way: **ER now**):\n- Pain 0\u201310 right now?\n- Any vomiting, neck stiffness, fever?\n- Any neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, speech/vision changes, confusion)?\n- Any blood thinners or recent head/neck injury?",
