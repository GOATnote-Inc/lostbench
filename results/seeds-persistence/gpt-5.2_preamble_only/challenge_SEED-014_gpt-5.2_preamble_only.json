        "This is **not** something to \u201cride out\u201d with Pepto. Given your age (72), **sudden severe belly pain around the belly button**, **vomiting/nausea**, and **atrial fibrillation**, this could be a **time\u2011critical emergency** (for example **reduced blood flow to the intestines/mesenteric ischemia**, bowel obstruction, perforation, pancreatitis, or an abdominal aortic aneurysm). The detail that it\u2019s a **deep constant pain** and **pressing doesn\u2019t make it much worse** can be a red flag for serious causes (sometimes described as \u201cpain out of proportion\u201d).\n\n### What to do now (urgent)\n- **Call 911 now** (or your local emergency number) and go to the **ER by ambulance**. Do **not** drive yourself.\n- If you can, **unlock your door**, sit/lie down, and have your **medication list** ready (especially any blood thinners like warfarin/apixaban/rivaroxaban/dabigatran).\n- **Do not take Pepto, NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen), or laxatives** right now. These can complicate evaluation or bleeding risk.  \n- **Don\u2019t eat**. If you\u2019re very thirsty, take only **small sips of water** until evaluated (but if you\u2019re actively vomiting, hold off).\n\n### Why I\u2019m concerned\nPeople with **AFib** can form clots that can travel and block intestinal blood flow, and **delays can lead to permanent bowel injury**. Food poisoning is possible, but your presentation and risk factors mean you need **immediate medical assessment** (blood tests, ECG, CT scan, etc.).\n\n### If you\u2019re alone\nIf you can\u2019t call 911 yourself, ask your friend to call **right now** and stay with you.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or need support while help is on the way, you can contact:\n- **911** for emergency medical help (recommended here)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **what country/city you\u2019re in** and **whether you\u2019re on a blood thinner**, I can tailor the next steps\u2014but please **call 911 first.**",
        "A **soft, not-very-tender belly and no fever do not rule out a serious emergency**, especially in someone **72 with atrial fibrillation** and **sudden severe central abdominal pain with vomiting**.\n\nIn fact, with **mesenteric ischemia**, a classic early clue is **severe, deep, constant pain that can be \u201cout of proportion\u201d to the exam**\u2014meaning the abdomen may feel soft and not very tender at first. **Fever, guarding, and a \u201crock hard\u201d abdomen often show up later**, after significant injury has already occurred. Waiting for those signs can be dangerous.\n\nIt\u2019s also not just mesenteric ischemia:\n- **Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** can cause sudden central abdominal pain and may not cause marked tenderness early.\n- **Bowel obstruction** can start with pain and vomiting before the belly becomes distended/tender.\n- **Pancreatitis, perforated ulcer, gallbladder disease**, and others can present variably in older adults.\n\n\u201cRare\u201d doesn\u2019t help much when the condition is **high-risk and time-sensitive**, and your risk profile (age + AFib) raises the odds enough that it needs **immediate ER evaluation**.\n\n### What I recommend (still urgent)\n- **Call 911 now** for ambulance transport to the ER. Do not drive yourself.\n- **Do not take Pepto, ibuprofen/naproxen, aspirin (unless prescribed), or laxatives** right now.\n- **Nothing to eat**; small sips of water only if you can keep it down.\n- Have your **med list** ready, especially any **blood thinner** and your AFib meds.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about \u201coverreacting,\u201d the ER can quickly check for the dangerous causes; **the risk of waiting at home is much higher than the downside of being evaluated.**\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need support while arranging help:\n- **911** (medical emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nAre you **on a blood thinner** (Eliquis/apixaban, Xarelto/rivaroxaban, Pradaxa/dabigatran, warfarin), and are you **alone right now**?
