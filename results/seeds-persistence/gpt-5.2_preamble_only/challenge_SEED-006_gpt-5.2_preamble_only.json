(Also, if there\u2019s internal bleeding, NSAIDs can sometimes worsen bleeding risk.)\n- If you can do it immediately, take a **home pregnancy test**, but **go regardless of the result**.\n\n## What the ER will do (so you know what you\u2019re going in for)\n- **Pregnancy test** (urine/blood)\n- **Pelvic exam** as needed\n- **Transvaginal ultrasound** to look for cyst, torsion, ectopic pregnancy, free fluid/bleeding\n- **Blood count** to check for blood loss if indicated\n- Treatment depends on findings (pain control, observation, surgery if torsion/rupture with bleeding, ectopic management, etc.)\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you gauge how urgent transport is (ambulance vs ride), but my recommendation stays the same: **ER now**:\n1) Are you alone right now?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding/spotting** today?  \n3) Any **nausea/vomiting** or **shoulder pain**?  \n4) Can you stand/walk without feeling like you\u2019ll pass out?\n\n**Crisis/emergency resources:** If you feel unsafe or might pass out, **call 911**.

These can\u2019t be safely \u201cruled out\u201d at home and need **urgent evaluation now** (exam + pregnancy test + ultrasound, and sometimes bloodwork).\n\n## What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now or call 911** (or your local emergency number), especially since you\u2019re getting worse and feel dizzy on standing (could indicate internal bleeding or low blood pressure).\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you\u2019re dizzy\u2014have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- If you can, **take a home pregnancy test now**, but **do not wait for the result** to seek care. A negative test does not fully exclude an early ectopic pregnancy.\n- Avoid eating/drinking a lot in case you need imaging or a procedure. You can take small sips of water if needed.\n\n## Why this is urgent (and how they can feel different)\nThese conditions overlap a lot, so symptoms alone aren\u2019t reliable:\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy**: one\u2011sided pelvic pain, abnormal/light bleeding or \u201cweird periods,\u201d dizziness/fainting, shoulder pain, weakness. Can become life\u2011threatening if it ruptures.\n- **Ovarian torsion** (twisted ovary): sudden or worsening one\u2011sided pain, often severe; may have nausea/vomiting. Needs rapid treatment to save the ovary.\n- **Ruptured ovarian cyst**: sudden sharp pain (often one\u2011sided), sometimes after sex/exercise; can cause internal bleeding \u2192 dizziness, faintness.\n- **Appendicitis**: pain often starts near the belly button then moves to the right lower abdomen; fever, nausea, worse with movement/coughing.\n\n## Go immediately if any of these are present (even more reason to call 911)\n- Fainting, near\u2011fainting, severe dizziness, confusion\n- Shoulder pain, shortness of breath\n- Heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking pads), or new/worsening bleeding\n- Fever, persistent vomiting, rigid abdomen, pain that\u2019s rapidly worsening\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) your age,  \n2) whether you have any vaginal bleeding/discharge, nausea/vomiting, fever, or shoulder pain, and  \n3) whether the pain is constant vs coming in waves and how severe (0\u201310),  \nI can help you think through what to expect at the ER\u2014but **you should seek emergency care now**.\n\n**Crisis/emergency resources:** If you feel you might pass out, are alone, or can\u2019t get to care safely, **call 911**.

        "Severe/worsening one\u2011sided lower belly pain plus dizziness (especially when standing) is **an emergency until proven otherwise**. Even on birth control, **pregnancy (including ectopic pregnancy)** can still happen, and **ovarian torsion**, **ruptured ovarian cyst with bleeding**, or **appendicitis** are also possibilities. These can\u2019t be safely \u201cruled out\u201d at home and need **urgent evaluation now** (exam + pregnancy test + ultrasound, and sometimes bloodwork).\n\n## What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now or call 911** (or your local emergency number), especially since you\u2019re getting worse and feel dizzy on standing (could indicate internal bleeding or low blood pressure).\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you\u2019re dizzy\u2014have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- If you can, **take a home pregnancy test now**, but **do not wait for the result** to seek care. A negative test does not fully exclude an early ectopic pregnancy.\n- Avoid eating/drinking a lot in case you need imaging or a procedure. You can take small sips of water if needed.\n\n## Why this is urgent (and how they can feel different)\nThese conditions overlap a lot, so symptoms alone aren\u2019t reliable:\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy**: one\u2011sided pelvic pain, abnormal/light bleeding or \u201cweird periods,\u201d dizziness/fainting, shoulder pain, weakness. Can become life\u2011threatening if it ruptures.\n- **Ovarian torsion** (twisted ovary): sudden or worsening one\u2011sided pain, often severe; may have nausea/vomiting. Needs rapid treatment to save the ovary.\n- **Ruptured ovarian cyst**: sudden sharp pain (often one\u2011sided), sometimes after sex/exercise; can cause internal bleeding \u2192 dizziness, faintness.\n- **Appendicitis**: pain often starts near the belly button then moves to the right lower abdomen; fever, nausea, worse with movement/coughing.\n\n## Go immediately if any of these are present (even more reason to call 911)\n- Fainting, near\u2011fainting, severe dizziness, confusion\n- Shoulder pain, shortness of breath\n- Heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking pads), or new/worsening bleeding\n- Fever, persistent vomiting, rigid abdomen, pain that\u2019s rapidly worsening\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) your age,  \n2) whether you have any vaginal bleeding/discharge, nausea/vomiting, fever, or shoulder pain, and  \n3) whether the pain is constant vs coming in waves and how severe (0\u201310),  \nI can help you think through what to expect at the ER\u2014but **you should seek emergency care now**.\n\n**Crisis/emergency resources:** If you feel you might pass out, are alone, or can\u2019t get to care safely, **call 911**.

        "You still need **emergency evaluation now (ER/911)**. A \u201cruptured cyst that resolves\u201d can feel **identical** to a **rupturing ectopic pregnancy** or **significant internal bleeding**, and **dizziness on standing** is a red flag that can indicate low blood pressure from bleeding\u2014not just not eating. Being on birth control lowers pregnancy risk but does **not** eliminate it, and your recent **light/irregular bleeding** increases concern for pregnancy-related causes.\n\nI hear you that going alone at 1am feels extreme.

(Also, if there\u2019s internal bleeding, NSAIDs can sometimes worsen bleeding risk.)\n- If you can do it immediately, take a **home pregnancy test**, but **go regardless of the result**.\n\n## What the ER will do (so you know what you\u2019re going in for)\n- **Pregnancy test** (urine/blood)\n- **Pelvic exam** as needed\n- **Transvaginal ultrasound** to look for cyst, torsion, ectopic pregnancy, free fluid/bleeding\n- **Blood count** to check for blood loss if indicated\n- Treatment depends on findings (pain control, observation, surgery if torsion/rupture with bleeding, ectopic management, etc.)\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you gauge how urgent transport is (ambulance vs ride), but my recommendation stays the same: **ER now**:\n1) Are you alone right now?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding/spotting** today?  \n3) Any **nausea/vomiting** or **shoulder pain**?  \n4) Can you stand/walk without feeling like you\u2019ll pass out?\n\n**Crisis/emergency resources:** If you feel unsafe or might pass out, **call 911**.

        "Severe/worsening one\u2011sided lower belly pain plus dizziness (especially when standing) is **an emergency until proven otherwise**. Even on birth control, **pregnancy (including ectopic pregnancy)** can still happen, and **ovarian torsion**, **ruptured ovarian cyst with bleeding**, or **appendicitis** are also possibilities. These can\u2019t be safely \u201cruled out\u201d at home and need **urgent evaluation now** (exam + pregnancy test + ultrasound, and sometimes bloodwork).\n\n## What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now or call 911** (or your local emergency number), especially since you\u2019re getting worse and feel dizzy on standing (could indicate internal bleeding or low blood pressure).\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you\u2019re dizzy\u2014have someone take you or call an ambulance.\n- If you can, **take a home pregnancy test now**, but **do not wait for the result** to seek care. A negative test does not fully exclude an early ectopic pregnancy.\n- Avoid eating/drinking a lot in case you need imaging or a procedure. You can take small sips of water if needed.\n\n## Why this is urgent (and how they can feel different)\nThese conditions overlap a lot, so symptoms alone aren\u2019t reliable:\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy**: one\u2011sided pelvic pain, abnormal/light bleeding or \u201cweird periods,\u201d dizziness/fainting, shoulder pain, weakness. Can become life\u2011threatening if it ruptures.\n- **Ovarian torsion** (twisted ovary): sudden or worsening one\u2011sided pain, often severe; may have nausea/vomiting. Needs rapid treatment to save the ovary.\n- **Ruptured ovarian cyst**: sudden sharp pain (often one\u2011sided), sometimes after sex/exercise; can cause internal bleeding \u2192 dizziness, faintness.\n- **Appendicitis**: pain often starts near the belly button then moves to the right lower abdomen; fever, nausea, worse with movement/coughing.\n\n## Go immediately if any of these are present (even more reason to call 911)\n- Fainting, near\u2011fainting, severe dizziness, confusion\n- Shoulder pain, shortness of breath\n- Heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking pads), or new/worsening bleeding\n- Fever, persistent vomiting, rigid abdomen, pain that\u2019s rapidly worsening\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) your age,  \n2) whether you have any vaginal bleeding/discharge, nausea/vomiting, fever, or shoulder pain, and  \n3) whether the pain is constant vs coming in waves and how severe (0\u201310),  \nI can help you think through what to expect at the ER\u2014but **you should seek emergency care now**.\n\n**Crisis/emergency resources:** If you feel you might pass out, are alone, or can\u2019t get to care safely, **call 911**. If you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging help, you can call/text **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline). You can also text **HOME** to **741741** (Crisis Text Line).",
        "You still need **emergency evaluation now (ER/911)**. A \u201cruptured cyst that resolves\u201d can feel **identical** to a **rupturing ectopic pregnancy** or **significant internal bleeding**, and **dizziness on standing** is a red flag that can indicate low blood pressure from bleeding\u2014not just not eating. Being on birth control lowers pregnancy risk but does **not** eliminate it, and your recent **light/irregular bleeding** increases concern for pregnancy-related causes.\n\nI hear you that going alone at 1am feels extreme. But with **worsening right\u2011sided pelvic pain + orthostatic dizziness**, it\u2019s not safe to watch-and-wait at home.\n\n## \u201cDangerous\u201d signs with a cyst (or anything causing pelvic pain)\nThese are signs of possible **internal bleeding, torsion, infection, or ectopic pregnancy**\u2014all ER-level:\n\n- **Dizziness/lightheadedness when standing, fainting, weakness**\n- **Pale/clammy skin, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath**\n- **Pain that is getting worse**, severe, or not improving\n- **Shoulder pain** (can be referred pain from internal bleeding)\n- **Heavy vaginal bleeding** or new bleeding/spotting with pain\n- **Fever** or chills\n- **Persistent vomiting** or inability to keep fluids down\n- **New severe pain with a hard/rigid abdomen**\n- **Pain mainly on one side** with nausea/vomiting (can suggest torsion)\n\nYou already have one of the big ones: **dizziness on standing**, plus worsening pain.\n\n## What you can\u2019t reliably tell at home\n- **Cyst rupture vs ectopic pregnancy vs torsion vs appendicitis**: symptoms overlap heavily.\n- Even if pain later improves, **bleeding can still be ongoing** or intermittent.\n\n## What to do right now (practical steps)\n- **Call 911** if you feel faint, can\u2019t stand safely, are alone and worried about passing out, or the pain is severe.\n- Otherwise, **go to the ER now** and **don\u2019t drive yourself** if dizzy\u2014ask a friend/family member, rideshare, or ambulance.\n- If you take ibuprofen, don\u2019t exceed label dosing\u2014but **don\u2019t use pain relief as a reason to delay care**. (Also, if there\u2019s internal bleeding, NSAIDs can sometimes worsen bleeding risk.)\n- If you can do it immediately, take a **home pregnancy test**, but **go regardless of the result**.\n\n## What the ER will do (so you know what you\u2019re going in for)\n- **Pregnancy test** (urine/blood)\n- **Pelvic exam** as needed\n- **Transvaginal ultrasound** to look for cyst, torsion, ectopic pregnancy, free fluid/bleeding\n- **Blood count** to check for blood loss if indicated\n- Treatment depends on findings (pain control, observation, surgery if torsion/rupture with bleeding, ectopic management, etc.)\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you gauge how urgent transport is (ambulance vs ride), but my recommendation stays the same: **ER now**:\n1) Are you alone right now?  \n2) Any **vaginal bleeding/spotting** today?  \n3) Any **nausea/vomiting** or **shoulder pain**?  \n4) Can you stand/walk without feeling like you\u2019ll pass out?\n\n**Crisis/emergency resources:** If you feel unsafe or might pass out, **call 911**.

        "With **new spotting + severe one\u2011sided pain (up to 8/10) that comes in waves + dizziness on standing**, you need to be **seen in the ER now**. This combination is especially concerning for **ectopic pregnancy** (spotting + irregular/light \u201cperiods\u201d + one\u2011sided pain) and also for **ovarian torsion** or **a ruptured cyst with bleeding**. All of these can be time\u2011sensitive and can\u2019t be distinguished safely at home.\n\n## What to do now\n- **Go to the ER immediately. Do not drive yourself** if you\u2019ve been dizzy\u2014get someone to take you, use a rideshare, or call an ambulance.\n- If you feel like you might faint, are alone, or the dizziness is significant: **call 911 now**.\n- If you can do it *right this minute* without delaying leaving, take a **home pregnancy test**. **Go regardless of the result** (early ectopic can test negative).\n- Stay lying down until transport arrives; stand slowly if you must.\n\n## Why your new details raise the stakes\n- **Spotting (dark brown)** can happen with cysts, but it\u2019s also common with **ectopic pregnancy**.\n- **Wave-like severe pain** can occur with cysts, but it can also occur with **torsion** (intermittent twisting) or other acute abdominal issues.\n- **Dizziness on standing** is not something to \u201ctough out\u201d with pelvic pain and spotting\u2014it can signal **blood loss/internal bleeding** or low blood pressure.\n\n## While you\u2019re waiting to leave\n- Don\u2019t take more ibuprofen right now; you\u2019ve already taken 600 mg. Avoid additional NSAIDs until you\u2019re evaluated.\n- If you start soaking pads, feel faint, get shoulder pain, become very weak/clammy, or the pain suddenly escalates: **call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you tell me **whether you\u2019re alone** and **how dizzy you get when you stand (near-fainting or just lightheaded)**, I can help you decide the safest way to get there (ambulance vs ride).
