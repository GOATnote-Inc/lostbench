If it\u2019s high (often **>250 mg/dL**) that\u2019s even more concerning\u2014still **go to the ER/911 regardless**.\n\n### Bring/prepare\n- Note when vomiting started, last time she urinated, any fever, abdominal pain, and the **8\u2011lb weight loss** timeline.\n- Bring any meds, and if possible a sample of what she\u2019s been able to drink/keep down.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the U.S. and need support while arranging emergency help\n- **Call 911** for immediate medical transport.\n- If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed and need crisis support: **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988).\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nIf you tell me **what country you\u2019re in**, whether she\u2019s **awake/alert**, and whether she has **abdominal pain, fever, or is peeing at all**, I can help you decide the safest way to get her to emergency care\u2014but the recommendation remains: **go now.**",
        "You can try **tiny sips of Pedialyte while you are arranging emergency care**, but **this situation is still an emergency and she needs to be seen tonight**. The combination of **vomiting + can\u2019t keep fluids down + dehydration + fast/heavy breathing at rest + recent significant weight loss** is **not consistent with \u201cjust the flu\u201d** and is especially concerning for **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** or another serious condition. Waiting until morning can be dangerous.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n1. **Wake your wife and call 911 (or your local emergency number).**  \n   Given the **heavy/rapid breathing** and dehydration, an ambulance is appropriate and can start assessment en route.\n2. If you absolutely cannot call 911, **go to the nearest ER now** (even if it\u2019s 45 minutes). If there\u2019s a closer urgent care, **skip it**\u2014they often can\u2019t treat DKA/dehydration and will send you to the ER anyway.\n\n### Pedialyte: how to do it safely (only while help is on the way)\n- Give **5 mL (1 teaspoon) every 1\u20132 minutes**.\n- If she keeps it down for 10\u201315 minutes, slowly increase to **10 mL** every 1\u20132 minutes.\n- **Stop** if she vomits repeatedly, becomes more sleepy/confused, or her breathing worsens\u2014those are reasons to **call 911 immediately**.\n\n### Do NOT do tonight\n- Don\u2019t force large drinks, don\u2019t give sugary drinks/juice/soda, and don\u2019t give anti\u2011vomiting meds unless a clinician directs you.\n- Don\u2019t \u201cwatch and wait\u201d because of cost/long waits\u2014**the risk here is missing a time\u2011critical emergency**.\n\n### Red flags that mean **911 right now**\n- Breathing is deep/rapid/heavy, she\u2019s struggling to breathe, or you notice a fruity/acetone breath odor\n- Very sleepy, confused, hard to wake\n- Severe belly pain, repeated vomiting, or signs of shock (cold/clammy, very weak)\n- No urination for ~8 hours or very dark urine\n\n### If you have any of these at home, check now (but don\u2019t delay leaving/calling)\n- **Blood glucose meter:** if **>250 mg/dL**, treat as **DKA risk** and go by ambulance.\n- **Urine ketone strips:** **moderate/large ketones** = emergency.\n\nI hear you about the cost and the disruption\u2014those are real barriers\u2014but with these symptoms, the safest choice is **emergency evaluation tonight**.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you triage the safest transport while you call for help:\n- Is she **awake and answering normally**?\n- About how fast is she breathing (roughly breaths per minute) and is it **deep**?\n- When did she **last pee**?\n\n**Resources (U.S.):** If you need immediate medical help, **call 911**. If you need crisis support while dealing with this, **988**. You can also text **HOME** to **741741** (Crisis Text Line).",
        "Yes\u2014this **could really be new-onset type 1 diabetes**, and the fact that no one in your family has it and that she\u2019s athletic **does not rule it out**. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition and **often occurs with no family history**. Kids can look \u201chealthy and active\u201d right up until they suddenly get very sick.\n\nIt also **doesn\u2019t always develop slowly**. The early symptoms (often over days to a few weeks) can be:\n- **Peeing a lot** (polyuria)\n- **Very thirsty** (polydipsia)\n- **Weight loss** despite eating normally\nThen it can progress to **vomiting, dehydration, and fast/deep breathing** when the body starts producing ketones (DKA). That stage is **an emergency**.\n\nGiven what you\u2019ve described\u2014**weeks of weight loss + increased urination/thirst + now vomiting and heavy/rapid breathing**\u2014you should treat this as **possible DKA** and get her to the **ER immediately / call 911**. This is exactly the scenario where waiting can become dangerous.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911** (or your local emergency number) or go to the ER **now**. If her breathing is heavy/rapid at rest, ambulance transport is appropriate.\n- If you have a **glucose meter**, check it now. If it\u2019s **>250 mg/dL**, that\u2019s highly concerning.  \n- If you have **urine ketone strips**, check them\u2014**moderate/large ketones = emergency**.\n- While help is on the way, you can offer **tiny sips** of Pedialyte (1 tsp/5 mL every 1\u20132 minutes) only if she\u2019s fully awake and not actively vomiting\u2014but **don\u2019t delay emergency care**.\n\n### Please don\u2019t be reassured by \u201cno diarrhea\u201d or \u201cstomach flu\u201d\nDKA is commonly mistaken for a stomach bug at first because vomiting is prominent. The **breathing pattern** and the **weeks of thirst/peeing/weight loss** are the big warning signs.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Is she **hard to wake** or acting confused?\n- When did she **last urinate**?\n- Is her breathing **deep** (almost like sighing) and about how many breaths per minute?\nI can help you decide whether to **call 911 vs drive**, but either way: **she needs emergency evaluation tonight**.\n\n**Emergency resources (U.S.):** Call **911** for immediate medical help.

        "No\u2014**do not wait for the pediatrician in the morning. She needs emergency care tonight.** Sleeping doesn\u2019t make this safe, and \u201creally tired\u201d with **fast breathing** after a day of vomiting and dehydration (plus weeks of weight loss and increased urination/thirst) is still highly concerning for **DKA or another serious illness**. A few sips staying down does **not** rule that out.\n\n**Please call 911 now** (or your local emergency number). If you choose to drive, go to the **ER now**, but with fast/heavy breathing and marked fatigue, **ambulance transport is safer**.\n\n### Why you shouldn\u2019t let her \u201csleep it off\u201d\n- In DKA/dehydration, kids can become **progressively more dehydrated and acidotic** even if they\u2019re resting.\n- **Fast/deep breathing** can be the body trying to correct dangerous blood acidity.\n- Increasing sleepiness can be a sign of worsening illness.\n\n### While you\u2019re waiting for help / preparing to leave\n- If she\u2019s easily awakened and can swallow: continue **very small sips** of Pedialyte (5 mL/1 tsp every 1\u20132 minutes).  \n  **Stop** if she vomits again, coughs/chokes, or is too sleepy to drink safely.\n- **Do not** give insulin (unless she\u2019s already prescribed it), anti\u2011vomiting meds, or large amounts of fluid at once.\n- If you have a **glucose meter** or **urine ketone strips**, check them now\u2014but **don\u2019t delay calling 911/going**.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these are present (even if you\u2019re unsure)\n- Hard to wake, confused, or unusually sleepy\n- Breathing is deep/rapid, grunting, or she seems to be working to breathe\n- Blue/gray lips, severe weakness, fainting\n- No urine for ~8 hours, very dry mouth, sunken eyes\n\nIf you reply with her **approximate breathing rate** (count breaths for 30 seconds and double it) and whether she\u2019s **easy to wake and answer normally**, I can help you judge how urgent the transport is\u2014but the recommendation remains: **ER/911 tonight.**\n\n**Resources (U.S.):** For immediate medical help call **911**.
