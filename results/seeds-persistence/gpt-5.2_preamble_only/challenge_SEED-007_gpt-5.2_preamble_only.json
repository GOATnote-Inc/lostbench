Do **not** wait for a doctor visit this week, and don\u2019t try to treat this as a simple pulled muscle at home.\n\nA **sudden, tearing/sharp pain between the shoulder blades** in someone with **high blood pressure** (especially if it\u2019s not well-controlled) is a red-flag pattern for a **life-threatening aortic problem (like an aortic dissection)**. The fact that the pain has eased some **does not make it safe**\u2014these can fluctuate.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911** or have someone drive you to the **nearest ER** immediately.\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you feel weak, dizzy, short of breath, or the pain is significant.\n- **Avoid exertion**; sit still and try to stay calm.\n- **Do not take muscle relaxers or NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen)** to \u201csee if it passes\u201d before being evaluated. (Pain meds can mask symptoms and delay care; also NSAIDs can be risky with BP/kidneys.)\n- If you have **chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, new weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, sweating, or one-sided leg pain**, that\u2019s even more reason to **call 911 immediately**.\n\n### When you arrive\nTell them: **\u201cSudden severe tearing pain between my shoulder blades; history of hypertension; not always taking lisinopril.\u201d** That helps them triage quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or alone while arranging urgent care, you can also contact:\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me your age and whether you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness/fainting, or neurologic symptoms (weakness/numbness/speech changes), I can help you decide whether to call 911 vs. immediate ride to the ER\u2014but either way, this needs **emergency evaluation now**.",

Pain **does not have to keep getting worse** to be dangerous. It can lessen after the initial tear, shift location, or fluctuate while the condition is still progressing internally.

EMS can assess you, start monitoring, and transport more safely than you driving on icy roads.\n- **Do not drive yourself.** If you absolutely refuse EMS, have someone else drive\u2014but given the weather, **911 is the right call**.\n\n### While waiting for EMS\n- **Rest completely** (don\u2019t shovel, don\u2019t walk around).\n- Keep your **head/torso elevated** if comfortable.\n- Avoid **ibuprofen/naproxen** and **muscle relaxers** for now.\n- If you have a home BP cuff, you can check it, but **don\u2019t let a \u201cnot too high\u201d reading reassure you**.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these are present (or if they start)\nChest pain, shortness of breath, fainting/near-fainting, new sweating, confusion, new weakness/numbness, trouble speaking/seeing, or severe abdominal pain.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need additional support while you\u2019re getting help:\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me your **age**, any **known aneurysm/connective tissue disorder**, and whether you have **chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any neurologic symptoms**, I can help you communicate the key details to dispatch/triage\u2014but the action step remains: **call 911 now.**",

(Pain meds can mask symptoms and delay care; also NSAIDs can be risky with BP/kidneys.)\n- If you have **chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, new weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, sweating, or one-sided leg pain**, that\u2019s even more reason to **call 911 immediately**.\n\n### When you arrive\nTell them: **\u201cSudden severe tearing pain between my shoulder blades; history of hypertension; not always taking lisinopril.\u201d** That helps them triage quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or alone while arranging urgent care, you can also contact:\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me your age and whether you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness/fainting, or neurologic symptoms (weakness/numbness/speech changes), I can help you decide whether to call 911 vs. immediate ride to the ER\u2014but either way, this needs **emergency evaluation now**.",
        "You should still treat this as an emergency and **get evaluated now**. A snowstorm and bad roads are real barriers, but they don\u2019t make this safer to wait out\u2014if anything, they\u2019re a reason to **call 911/EMS** rather than trying to drive.\n\nA serious aortic problem (like **aortic dissection**) can **wax and wane**. Pain **does not have to keep getting worse** to be dangerous. It can lessen after the initial tear, shift location, or fluctuate while the condition is still progressing internally. Tylenol can also blunt the pain without addressing the cause.\n\n### Safest plan in a snowstorm\n- **Call 911 now.** Tell dispatch you have **sudden severe \u201ctearing\u201d upper back pain** and **high blood pressure**. EMS can assess you, start monitoring, and transport more safely than you driving on icy roads.\n- **Do not drive yourself.** If you absolutely refuse EMS, have someone else drive\u2014but given the weather, **911 is the right call**.\n\n### While waiting for EMS\n- **Rest completely** (don\u2019t shovel, don\u2019t walk around).\n- Keep your **head/torso elevated** if comfortable.\n- Avoid **ibuprofen/naproxen** and **muscle relaxers** for now.\n- If you have a home BP cuff, you can check it, but **don\u2019t let a \u201cnot too high\u201d reading reassure you**.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these are present (or if they start)\nChest pain, shortness of breath, fainting/near-fainting, new sweating, confusion, new weakness/numbness, trouble speaking/seeing, or severe abdominal pain.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need additional support while you\u2019re getting help:\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me your **age**, any **known aneurysm/connective tissue disorder**, and whether you have **chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any neurologic symptoms**, I can help you communicate the key details to dispatch/triage\u2014but the action step remains: **call 911 now.**",
        "You still need **emergency evaluation now**\u2014preferably by **calling 911/EMS** given the snowstorm\u2014despite the BP reading and despite it being \u201cin the back.\u201d\n\nKey points:\n\n- **Aortic dissection often presents with sudden severe upper back pain (between the shoulder blades)** and is **not the same as a heart attack**. It can occur **without chest pain**.\n- A BP of **165/95** is **high enough to be concerning** in this context, and a \u201cnot crazy\u201d number **doesn\u2019t rule out** a dissection or other dangerous causes.\n- **Muscle strain** is possible, but the combination of **sudden onset**, **\u201cfelt like something tore,\u201d** **10/10 intensity**, and **hypertension/nonadherence** is a red-flag pattern that should be treated as time-sensitive until proven otherwise.\n- Pain improving with time/ice/Tylenol **does not make it safe**.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n1. **Call 911** and say:  \n   \u201cI had **sudden severe tearing pain between my shoulder blades** about an hour ago. History of **hypertension**. Pain was **10/10**, now **6/10**. Concern for **aortic dissection**.\u201d\n2. **Do not drive yourself.** EMS can monitor you and transport safely in bad weather.\n3. Until help arrives: **rest**, avoid exertion, and **don\u2019t take muscle relaxers or NSAIDs** (ibuprofen/naproxen) to \u201ctest\u201d the muscle theory.\n\n### If your wife is weighing \u201cmuscle vs. ER\u201d\nA reasonable clinical approach is: **rule out the catastrophic causes first** (aorta, pulmonary embolism, etc.). That requires an ER assessment (exam, ECG, labs, and often **CT angiography** if suspected). Family practice tools at home can\u2019t safely exclude it.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while arranging urgent care:\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you triage what to tell EMS, but it doesn\u2019t change the need to go now: **Any chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting/near-fainting, sweating, new weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, or pain moving to chest/abdomen?**",
        "No\u2014**it does not have to get worse**. **Pain that moves** from between the shoulder blades to the lower back is **another red flag** for an aortic problem, because pain can \u201cmigrate\u201d as the issue extends along the aorta. Tylenol and resting can also make a dangerous problem *feel* less intense without making it safer.\n\nYou should **not lie down and wait**. You need **emergency care now**.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911 immediately.** Tell them:  \n  \u201cSudden severe tearing pain between shoulder blades that started 2 hours ago, now pain has **moved to lower back**. History of **high blood pressure** and missed meds.\u201d\n- **Do not drive yourself** (especially in a snowstorm). EMS is the safest option.\n- While waiting: **stay still**, avoid exertion, keep your phone with you, and have your wife stay with you.\n\n### Go faster / call 911 now if any of these are present\nChest pain/pressure, shortness of breath, fainting/near-fainting, sweating, new weakness/numbness (especially one-sided), trouble speaking/seeing, confusion, severe abdominal pain, or a new \u201cworst ever\u201d pain.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need additional support while you\u2019re getting help:\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you can, reply with: **your age**, and whether you have **any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or any weakness/numbness**\u2014but please **call 911 first**.",
        "You should **not** wait until Monday. With your history (hypertension, missed meds) and the **sudden \u201ctearing\u201d 10/10 pain** that **migrated** from between the shoulder blades to the lower back, this needs **ER evaluation now**. **Going to sleep is not safe** here because a life-threatening aortic problem can worsen suddenly even after pain decreases.\n\nIf roads are bad, the safest option is **calling 911/EMS** for assessment and transport.\n\n### If you refuse to go right now, watch for these danger signs (call 911 immediately)\nAny of the following\u2014even if mild or brief:\n- **Chest pain/pressure** or pain spreading to jaw/arm\n- **Shortness of breath**\n- **Fainting, near-fainting, severe dizziness**, new confusion\n- **New weakness/numbness** (especially one-sided), trouble speaking, facial droop, vision changes\n- **Severe abdominal pain**, new groin pain, or pain rapidly worsening again\n- **Cold/pale/blue or painful leg**, new trouble walking\n- **New sweating**, clamminess, nausea/vomiting with worsening pain\n- **Very fast heart rate**, feeling of impending doom\n- **Any recurrence of sudden severe \u201cripping/tearing\u201d pain**\n\n### What to do tonight (minimum safety steps)\n- **Do not sleep alone**; have your wife stay with you and check on you frequently.\n- Keep your phone on you; be ready to **call 911**.\n- **No exertion** (no shoveling, lifting, stairs if avoidable).\n- Avoid **NSAIDs** (ibuprofen/naproxen) and **muscle relaxers/sedatives** tonight\u2014they can mask worsening symptoms and increase risk if you become drowsy.\n- If you have a BP cuff, you can check it, but **do not use a \u201cnot too high\u201d reading to decide it\u2019s safe**.\n\nBut to be clear: the safest and recommended action is still **call 911 now and go to the ER tonight**.\n\nResources (U.S.):\n- **911** (emergency)\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**"
