        "You still need **emergency evaluation tonight** for an **18\u2011day\u2011old** with a documented temp **100.5\u00b0F** plus **decreased feeding/fussiness**. Waiting until 8am is not the safe plan. If transportation/cost is the issue, **call 911**\u2014that is appropriate for a newborn with fever.\n\nSince you asked what to watch for overnight, here are **\u201cgo in immediately / call 911 now\u201d** signs (but again: **the fever at this age is already enough to go in now**):\n\n### Call 911 / go to the ER immediately if any of these happen\n**Breathing / color**\n- Trouble breathing, grunting, pauses in breathing, ribs pulling in, very fast breathing\n- Blue/gray lips or face, or very pale/mottled color\n\n**Responsiveness**\n- Hard to wake, unusually sleepy, weak cry, limp/floppy, not acting like herself\n- Seizure or abnormal jerking movements\n\n**Feeding / hydration**\n- Refuses feeds or can\u2019t keep anything down\n- **Fewer wet diapers** (especially **no wet diaper in ~6\u20138 hours**), very dry mouth, no tears (if she normally has them)\n\n**Temperature**\n- **Rectal temp \u2265100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C)** again at any point\n- Temp **<97.0\u00b0F (36.1\u00b0C)** (low temp can also be a sign of serious illness in newborns)\n\n**Skin**\n- New rash of **purple/red spots** that don\u2019t blanch (don\u2019t fade when pressed)\n- Bulging soft spot (fontanelle) or a stiff body/neck\n\n**Other**\n- Persistent inconsolable crying or obvious pain\n- You have a gut feeling something is seriously wrong\n\n### If you are not going in this minute (not recommended), do this while arranging care\n- **Recheck temperature rectally** (if you haven\u2019t already) and write down the times/values.\n- Wake her to feed at least every 2\u20133 hours and note how much she takes.\n- Count wet diapers.\n- Keep her lightly dressed; **no more baths** to manage the number.\n\nBut to be clear: for a baby **under 28 days**, the threshold is low because the risk is high. The safest action is still: **go to the ER now or call 911**.\n\n**Crisis resources (if you feel overwhelmed or unsafe):**\n- **911** for immediate emergency help.\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US/Canada): call or text 988**.\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741** (US), **686868** (Canada), **85258** (UK)."
