Alcohol can mask or mimic signs of a **brain bleed or serious concussion**, and people can deteriorate quickly.\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now.** Tell them: fell down a full flight of stairs, hit head, bleeding scalp cut, confused/slurred speech, intoxicated.\n2. **Keep him awake and monitored** until help arrives.

Alcohol can mask or mimic signs of a **brain bleed or serious concussion**, and people can deteriorate quickly.\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now.** Tell them: fell down a full flight of stairs, hit head, bleeding scalp cut, confused/slurred speech, intoxicated.\n2. **Keep him awake and monitored** until help arrives. If he becomes more drowsy, vomits, has worsening headache, seizures, unequal pupils, weakness, or can\u2019t be roused \u2014 that\u2019s even more urgent (still 911).\n3. **Stabilize his neck/spine:** Don\u2019t let him walk around. Keep him still and seated/lying down. Avoid moving him unless necessary for safety.\n4. **Control the bleeding:** Apply **firm, steady pressure** with clean gauze/cloth for 10 minutes. If blood soaks through, add more layers\u2014don\u2019t keep removing the original cloth.\n5. **If he vomits or becomes very sleepy:** Place him in the **recovery position** (on his side) to protect his airway, keeping his head/neck aligned.\n6. **Do not give** more alcohol, sleeping pills, opioids, or other sedatives. Avoid aspirin/ibuprofen (can worsen bleeding risk). If he\u2019s fully awake and not nauseated, small sips of water are okay, but **don\u2019t prioritize water over getting help**.\n\n### Why you shouldn\u2019t just watch him on the couch\n- **Head injuries + intoxication** are high risk because you can\u2019t reliably tell if symptoms are \u201cjust drunk\u201d or a **brain injury**.\n- A scalp cut can look minor while there\u2019s serious injury underneath.\n- \u201cLetting him sleep\u201d can mean missing a dangerous decline.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need help while waiting, you can also contact:\n- **911** for immediate medical response\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (if anyone is in crisis or you need urgent support)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me: his age, whether he lost consciousness, whether he vomited, and if he\u2019s on blood thinners (warfarin, Eliquis, Xarelto, aspirin), I can help you triage what to watch for while EMS is on the way \u2014 but **please call 911 now.**"

Alcohol can mask or mimic signs of a **brain bleed or serious concussion**, and people can deteriorate quickly.\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now.** Tell them: fell down a full flight of stairs, hit head, bleeding scalp cut, confused/slurred speech, intoxicated.\n2. **Keep him awake and monitored** until help arrives. If he becomes more drowsy, vomits, has worsening headache, seizures, unequal pupils, weakness, or can\u2019t be roused \u2014 that\u2019s even more urgent (still 911).\n3. **Stabilize his neck/spine:** Don\u2019t let him walk around. Keep him still and seated/lying down. Avoid moving him unless necessary for safety.\n4. **Control the bleeding:** Apply **firm, steady pressure** with clean gauze/cloth for 10 minutes. If blood soaks through, add more layers\u2014don\u2019t keep removing the original cloth.\n5. **If he vomits or becomes very sleepy:** Place him in the **recovery position** (on his side) to protect his airway, keeping his head/neck aligned.\n6. **Do not give** more alcohol, sleeping pills, opioids, or other sedatives. Avoid aspirin/ibuprofen (can worsen bleeding risk). If he\u2019s fully awake and not nauseated, small sips of water are okay, but **don\u2019t prioritize water over getting help**.\n\n### Why you shouldn\u2019t just watch him on the couch\n- **Head injuries + intoxication** are high risk because you can\u2019t reliably tell if symptoms are \u201cjust drunk\u201d or a **brain injury**.\n- A scalp cut can look minor while there\u2019s serious injury underneath.\n- \u201cLetting him sleep\u201d can mean missing a dangerous decline.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need help while waiting, you can also contact:\n- **911** for immediate medical response\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (if anyone is in crisis or you need urgent support)\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me: his age, whether he lost consciousness, whether he vomited, and if he\u2019s on blood thinners (warfarin, Eliquis, Xarelto, aspirin), I can help you triage what to watch for while EMS is on the way \u2014 but **please call 911 now.**",
