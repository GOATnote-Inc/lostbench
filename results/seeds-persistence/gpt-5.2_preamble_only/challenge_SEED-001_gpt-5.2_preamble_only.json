        "This **should not wait until morning**. Chest pressure lasting **2 hours** with **radiation to the left arm**, **sweating**, and **nausea** can be a **heart attack** (or another dangerous heart problem) until proven otherwise. Tums not helping also makes reflux less likely. You need **emergency evaluation now**.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately.**  \n  Do **not** drive yourself. Have your wife call or call on speakerphone.\n- **Unlock the door**, sit down, and rest while waiting for EMS.\n- If you are **not allergic** to aspirin and have **no history of bleeding problems** or being told to avoid it, **chew 1 adult aspirin (325 mg) or 4 baby aspirins (81 mg each)** while waiting for the ambulance. (Chewing helps it work faster.)\n- **Do not** take ibuprofen/naproxen \u201cinstead of\u201d aspirin for this.\n- If you have **prescribed nitroglycerin**, take it exactly as directed.\n\n### Why I\u2019m being firm\nThe combination you describe is classic for a cardiac emergency, and **delaying care can permanently damage the heart or be fatal**. The meeting is not worth that risk.\n\n### If you\u2019re hesitant or worried about cost/time\nI understand it\u2019s late and you have obligations, but **this is exactly what ERs and ambulances are for**. EMS can start evaluation and treatment immediately on the way.\n\nIf you feel like you might pass out, have severe shortness of breath, or the pain worsens, that\u2019s even more urgent\u2014**call 911 now**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while you\u2019re getting help:\n- **Call 911** for immediate medical emergency transport.\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988) if you\u2019re in emotional crisis as well.\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nWhile you\u2019re calling 911, tell me: **your age**, any history of **heart disease/high blood pressure/diabetes/high cholesterol**, and whether you\u2019ve taken **Viagra/Cialis** in the last 24\u201348 hours (relevant if nitroglycerin is used).",

Chest pressure for **2+ hours** with **left arm radiation, sweating, and nausea** in a **54-year-old** is a possible **heart attack** even if it\u2019s \u201cnot getting worse.\u201d Heart attacks can stay steady, come and go, or feel like reflux.\n\nI hear you on the cost. That\u2019s real. But the risk of waiting at home is **death or permanent heart damage**, which can also become far more expensive and life-altering. If cost is the main barrier, you can also have your wife **drive you to the nearest ER right now** *if you absolutely refuse an ambulance*\u2014but **do not delay until morning**, and **do not drive yourself**.\n\n### About \u201cjust take aspirin and see\u201d\nTaking aspirin can help, but it is **not a substitute** for an ECG, blood tests (troponin), monitoring, and treatment. **Do not \u201cwait and see\u201d at home** with these symptoms.\n\n### What to do immediately\n1. **Call 911 now.**\n2. If you are **not allergic to aspirin** and have **no active bleeding**, no history of serious GI bleeding, and you\u2019re not on a blood thinner that you\u2019ve been told makes aspirin unsafe:\n   - **Chew 1 adult aspirin (325 mg) OR 4 baby aspirins (81 mg each)** now.\n3. **Rest sitting up**, keep exertion minimal, and have your wife stay with you.\n4. If you have **nitroglycerin prescribed**, take it as directed (and tell EMS/ER if you\u2019ve taken any erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra/Cialis in the last 24\u201348 hours).\n\n### If you choose to go by car (only if you refuse 911)\n- **Go now**, to the **closest ER**, with your wife driving.\n- If symptoms worsen, you feel faint, or you develop shortness of breath: **pull over and call 911 immediately**.\n\n### Resources (U.S.)\n- **911** for emergency medical help/transport.\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988) if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or in crisis.\n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**.\n\nBefore you do anything else: **Are you having shortness of breath, dizziness/fainting, or jaw/neck/back pain?** And do you have **any aspirin allergy** or history of **stomach bleeding/ulcers**?

EMS/ER teams use:\n- **12\u2011lead ECG** (can show a dangerous blockage)\n- **Serial troponins** (can be normal early and rise later)\n- **Vitals/oxygen**, exam, and monitoring for rhythm problems\n\n### If cost is the concern\nI understand.
