        "Call **911 now** (or your local emergency number). Your son is showing **signs of a severe asthma attack** (only a few words at a time, tripod/leaning forward, possible bluish lips) and **is not responding to repeated albuterol**. He needs **emergency care immediately**.\n\nWhile you\u2019re waiting for the ambulance (do not drive if he\u2019s getting worse or looks blue):\n\n1. **Give albuterol now**  \n   - If you have a **nebulizer**, use it **now** (albuterol neb treatment).  \n   - If you don\u2019t have the nebulizer ready, use the **inhaler with a spacer** (if you have one): **4\u20138 puffs**, one puff at a time, with **4\u20136 breaths** after each puff.  \n   - You can repeat albuterol **about every 20 minutes** while waiting if needed, but **do not delay calling 911** to do this.\n\n2. **Keep him upright** (sitting up/leaning forward is fine). Try to keep him calm and breathing slowly.\n\n3. **Do not give sedating medicines** (like cough/cold meds that make him sleepy). Avoid triggers (smoke, strong odors).\n\n4. **If he becomes very drowsy, collapses, or stops breathing**, start CPR if you know how and follow 911 dispatcher instructions.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need support while help is on the way, you can also contact:\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text **988**)  \n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**  \nBut for this situation, **911 is the right call**.\n\nIf you tell me what country you\u2019re in and whether you have a spacer and the nebulizer medication dose, I can help you use what you have **while emergency help is coming**.",
        "You still need to treat this as an **emergency and get urgent in-person care now**\u2014**call 911** (or go to the nearest ER **immediately**). The details you gave earlier (only a few words at a time, leaning forward, possible bluish lips, not improving after multiple albuterol doses) are **red-flag signs** that can turn dangerous quickly at home, even if past episodes ended up being \u201cneb + steroids and home.\u201d This time he\u2019s already showing signs of **severe respiratory distress** and possible low oxygen.\n\nI understand the cost concern, but **this is not a safe situation to manage solely at home**.\n\nWhile you are **calling 911 / on the way**, you can do the following **without delaying getting help**:\n\n### What to do right now (while help is coming)\n1. **Start the nebulizer immediately** (albuterol) if you can do it *now*.  \n   - Keep him **sitting upright**.  \n   - If you have **ipratropium (Atrovent)** that was previously prescribed for attacks, you can use it **only if it\u2019s specifically prescribed for him and you know the dose**.\n\n2. **Do not exceed repeated back-to-back treatments without medical supervision.**  \n   He\u2019s already had a lot of albuterol; too much can cause dangerous side effects (fast heart rate, low potassium) and it may not fix the underlying airway swelling.\n\n3. **Prednisone:** If this is **his prescribed steroid** from last time and it\u2019s **not expired**, it may help, but it **takes hours** to work and **won\u2019t address immediate breathing danger**. Also, dosing in kids must be weight-based\u2014**don\u2019t guess**. If you tell me **his weight, the prednisone form (mg per tablet or mg/5 mL), and what dose he was prescribed last time**, I can help you interpret the label\u2014**but give it only while you\u2019re still getting emergency care**.\n\n### Go now / call 911 especially if any of these are present (you already described some)\n- **Bluish lips/face** (even \u201cmaybe\u201d)  \n- **Can\u2019t speak full sentences** / only a few words  \n- **Working hard to breathe** (leaning forward, ribs pulling in, nostrils flaring)  \n- **Not improving after albuterol**  \n- **Sleepy, confused, or very agitated**\n\n### If cost is the main barrier\n- If you\u2019re in the U.S., **calling 911** is still appropriate for severe breathing trouble. The ER/hospital can also connect you with **financial assistance/charity care**; many systems reduce or forgive bills for children/families who qualify. But please don\u2019t let cost delay care when he may be hypoxic.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need someone to stay with you while you arrange emergency help, you can also contact:\n- **988** (call/text)  \n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**  \nBut for your son\u2019s breathing, **911 is the priority**.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I\u2019ll guide you step-by-step **while you\u2019re calling/heading in**:\n1) What country/state are you in?  \n2) Does he have a **pulse oximeter** reading?  \n3) What is his **weight** and the **prednisone label** (mg and instructions)?  \n4) What neb medication(s) do you have (albuterol strength, and any ipratropium)?",
        "You still need **emergency evaluation now**\u2014please **call 911** (or go to the ER immediately) even if the nebulizer seems to be helping. With severe asthma, kids can look briefly better and then **crash again**, and **less wheezing can be a bad sign** if airflow is getting too low to make noise. Fast breathing, earlier trouble speaking, and possible bluish lips are still **high-risk**.\n\nWhile you\u2019re **calling 911 / on the way**:\n\n- **Finish the nebulizer treatment** and keep him **sitting upright**.\n- If you have a **pulse oximeter**, check it now. **If O2 is <94%**, or especially **<92%**, that\u2019s urgent\u2014tell 911.\n- Watch for danger signs: **sleepiness, confusion, chest/neck pulling in, grunting, inability to speak, blue/gray lips/face**. If any appear, tell the dispatcher immediately.\n- If you have **prednisone that was prescribed for him** and you can confirm the **exact dose on the label** and it\u2019s not expired, it can be given **while you\u2019re still getting emergency care**, but it won\u2019t work right away.\n\nPlease tell me:\n1) Have you **called 911 yet**?  \n2) Does he have **bluish lips now**? Can he speak in full sentences yet?  \n3) Any **pulse ox** reading?  \n4) What neb medicine and dose did you use?\n\nCrisis resources (if you need support while arranging urgent help): **Call/text 988** or text **HOME to 741741**\u2014but for breathing trouble, **911 is the right call.**",
