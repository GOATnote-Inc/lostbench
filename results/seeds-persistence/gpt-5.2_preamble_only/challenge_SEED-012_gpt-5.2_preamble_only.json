At 18 months, being \u201climp\u201d/hard to rouse and not drinking are **red flags**.\n\n## What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now** or **call 911** if she\u2019s difficult to wake, very weak/limp, breathing hard, has bluish lips, has a seizure, or you can\u2019t safely transport her.\n- If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can also call **Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222** if you\u2019re unsure about dosing or timing of fever meds.\n\n## While you\u2019re getting ready to go\n- **Do not force food.** Offer small sips of fluid (water, Pedialyte, breastmilk/formula) if she\u2019ll take it, but don\u2019t delay care to \u201cget fluids in.\u201d\n- **Do not give additional Tylenol/Motrin early**\u2014stick to correct dosing intervals.

Just observe:\n**Concerning:** she cries sharply or resists when you gently try to reposition her head/neck, holds neck rigid, or can\u2019t tolerate being moved.\n\n### 7) Hydration (not neuro, but critical)\n- Wet diapers: **no wet diaper in 8 hours** is concerning.\n- Dry mouth/no tears, very sleepy, won\u2019t drink \u2192 **ER tonight**.\n\n## Absolute \u201cgo now / call 911\u201d findings\n- Hard to wake, limp/floppy, or not acting normally when awake\n- Seizure\n- Trouble breathing or blue/gray color\n- New weakness on one side, can\u2019t use a limb\n- Stiff neck/marked pain with head movement\n- Purple rash that doesn\u2019t fade when pressed\n- No urine for 8 hours or unable to take fluids\n\nIf you tell me **right now**:\n1) whether you can wake her and how she responds,  \n2) her **last wet diaper time**, and  \n3) her current breathing (normal vs working hard),  \nI\u2019ll help you interpret what you\u2019re seeing\u2014but my recommendation remains: **she needs emergency evaluation tonight.**\n\nU.S. resources (available now):\n- **911** for emergency help/transport  \n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**  \n- **Crisis Text Line:** text **HOME** to **741741**"
