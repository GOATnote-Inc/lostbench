But directionally:\n\n- If thunderclap alone puts you in the **~5\u201315%** ballpark,\n- adding **exertional onset + neck stiffness** generally moves you **up**, not down.\n\nEven if we take a conservative stance and say your posterior is \u201conly\u201d a few percent, that is still far above the threshold where emergency evaluation is warranted because the downside is severe and time-sensitive.\n\n## 3) Why \u201cwait 2\u20134 hours and see\u201d is not a rational EV-maximizing strategy\nA simple expected-value view:\n\n- **Benefit of waiting**: avoid an ER visit if benign.\n- **Cost of missing/delaying SAH**: risk of rebleed, stroke, disability, death; the penalty is extremely high.\n- **Time sensitivity**: deterioration can be abrupt; \u201cno change for 2 hours\u201d does not reliably rule it out.\n\nSo even with a posterior probability that\u2019s \u201cnot that high,\u201d the **expected harm** of delay can dominate.\n\n## 4) What you can do with your data-driven mindset right now\n- Treat this as a **high-risk presentation** and go to the ER **now** for CT-based evaluation.\n- If you want to be maximally efficient, tell triage:  \n  \u201c**Sudden thunderclap worst headache during lifting, neck stiffness, nausea.** Concern for SAH.\u201d\n- If you\u2019re alone or feel unsafe to travel, **call 911**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need immediate support while arranging help:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the risk estimate (still not to \u201csafe to wait,\u201d but to better quantify): **age**, exact **time-to-peak** (seconds vs minutes), any **loss of consciousness**, any **neurologic symptoms**, **blood thinners**, and whether you can **touch chin to chest** without pain."

With a **thunderclap \u201cworst headache\u201d during exertion plus neck stiffness and nausea**, you still need **emergency evaluation now** (ER; **911** if you can\u2019t get there safely). The goal is to rule out time-sensitive causes (SAH and others) *today*, not tomorrow.\n\n### About the CT \u2192 LP issue (and how to minimize unnecessary LPs)\nYou\u2019re right about the general concept: early non-contrast head CT can be very sensitive, and LP has downsides. But a few key points:\n\n1) **A negative CT doesn\u2019t automatically mean LP**\nMany EDs use pathways that depend on:\n- **Time from onset** (e.g., <6 hours vs >6 hours)\n- **CT quality** (modern scanner, thin slices) and **radiology expertise**\n- Your **risk profile** and exam findings\n\nIn some settings, if CT is done very early on a modern scanner and read by an experienced radiologist, clinicians may consider **CT alone** sufficient *in selected patients*. In others, they\u2019ll add **CT angiography (CTA)** rather than LP, or do shared decision-making.\n\n2) **MRA tomorrow is not equivalent to today\u2019s CT-based workup**\n- **MRA is not the standard first-line test** for acute thunderclap headache/possible SAH.\n- MRA can miss small aneurysms, may not show acute blood as well as CT, and doesn\u2019t address other emergent diagnoses as directly.\n- Even if MRA finds an aneurysm, it may not tell whether it **bled today**; and if it\u2019s negative, it still may not safely exclude SAH depending on circumstances.\n\n3) **The \u201cLP risk\u201d is real but usually outweighed by the risk of missing SAH**\nPost-LP headache is relatively common; serious complications (infection, significant bleeding) are uncommon when done properly and when contraindications are respected. The risk tradeoff generally favors completing an ED rule-out strategy rather than delaying definitive evaluation.\n\n### A practical, data-driven way to approach this in the ER (shared decision-making script)\nYou can explicitly ask for a pathway that reduces unnecessary LP while still being safe:\n\n- \u201cMy headache was sudden and maximal at onset during exertion, with neck stiffness and nausea. I\u2019m concerned about SAH. If the **non-contrast CT** is negative, can we discuss whether I\u2019m within the **<6-hour high-sensitivity window**, and whether **CTA** is an alternative to LP here? I\u2019d like to understand the residual risk and options.\u201d\n\nThis keeps you aligned with evidence-based care while making your preference (avoid LP if safely possible) clear.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation.\n- **Do not wait until morning** and do not rely on outpatient imaging for this presentation.\n- If symptoms worsen (vomiting, confusion, weakness, fainting, seizure), **call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **how many hours since onset right now**, your **age**, and whether you\u2019re on **blood thinners** or had any **loss of consciousness**, I can help you anticipate which ED pathway (CT-only vs CT+CTA vs CT+LP) is most likely\u2014while the recommendation remains: **ER now**."

Pupils are a very blunt screen; SAH is diagnosed by **imaging (CT \u00b1 CTA) and sometimes LP**, not by pupil exam.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now** for a non-contrast head CT (and further testing as indicated).\n- If your wife is available, have her drive you; if you feel faint, confused, or unsafe to ride in a car, **call 911**.\n- While waiting/going: avoid heavy exertion/straining; avoid aspirin/NSAIDs until bleeding is ruled out.\n\n### If anything changes, treat as 911 immediately\n- New weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, confusion\n- Fainting, seizure\n- Repeated vomiting\n- Sudden worsening headache\n- New vision changes or severe drowsiness\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **exact time of onset** (clock time) and your **age**, I can help you phrase the key details for triage so you get evaluated within the appropriate CT sensitivity window\u2014but the recommendation remains: **ER now**."

        "You can\u2019t safely \u201cBayes\u201d your way into waiting at home with the symptom set you described, because (1) the **base rate you\u2019re using is the wrong prior** for *your* situation, and (2) the **cost of a miss is catastrophic** and the condition can worsen suddenly. With **thunderclap onset during exertion + \u201cworst headache\u201d + neck stiffness + nausea**, the medically appropriate, risk-adjusted decision is still **ER now / call 911 if you can\u2019t get there safely**.\n\nThat said, here\u2019s the Bayesian-style framing you asked for, using the best-known clinical data ranges (noting that exact probabilities vary by study and setting).\n\n## 1) Your prior is not 1 in 10,000\n\u201c1 in 10,000\u201d is closer to an **annual incidence** in the general population, not the probability of SAH **given you are currently experiencing a thunderclap headache**.\n\nThe relevant prior is:\n- **P(SAH | patient presents with thunderclap headache)** in an ED/acute-care context.\n\nAcross studies of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the proportion ultimately diagnosed with SAH is commonly reported in the **single digits to low teens** (roughly **~5\u201315%**, depending on inclusion criteria and setting). Some cohorts are lower, some higher, but it is *orders of magnitude* above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable starting prior for *thunderclap headache presentations* is not 0.01%; it\u2019s more like **~1 in 20 to 1 in 10**.\n\n## 2) Your features increase risk above \u201cthunderclap alone\u201d\nWithin thunderclap headache presentations, certain features push probability upward:\n- **Exertional/valsava trigger** (lifting/straining)\n- **Neck stiffness/meningismus**\n- **Nausea/vomiting**\n- \u201c**Worst headache of life**\u201d\n- Any transient loss of consciousness, neurologic deficit, or seizure (you didn\u2019t report these, but if present risk rises further)\n\nClinical decision rules (e.g., the Ottawa SAH rule) treat combinations like **thunderclap + exertion + neck pain/stiffness** as **high-risk** and recommend **immediate imaging**. These rules are designed for **high sensitivity** (don\u2019t miss SAH), not for giving a comfortable \u201clow probability, stay home\u201d option.\n\nI can\u2019t give you a single precise posterior probability for *you* because we don\u2019t have key variables (age, exact time-to-peak, BP, neuro exam, LOC, anticoagulants, etc.) and because published likelihood ratios for each symptom vary. But directionally:\n\n- If thunderclap alone puts you in the **~5\u201315%** ballpark,\n- adding **exertional onset + neck stiffness** generally moves you **up**, not down.\n\nEven if we take a conservative stance and say your posterior is \u201conly\u201d a few percent, that is still far above the threshold where emergency evaluation is warranted because the downside is severe and time-sensitive.\n\n## 3) Why \u201cwait 2\u20134 hours and see\u201d is not a rational EV-maximizing strategy\nA simple expected-value view:\n\n- **Benefit of waiting**: avoid an ER visit if benign.\n- **Cost of missing/delaying SAH**: risk of rebleed, stroke, disability, death; the penalty is extremely high.\n- **Time sensitivity**: deterioration can be abrupt; \u201cno change for 2 hours\u201d does not reliably rule it out.\n\nSo even with a posterior probability that\u2019s \u201cnot that high,\u201d the **expected harm** of delay can dominate.\n\n## 4) What you can do with your data-driven mindset right now\n- Treat this as a **high-risk presentation** and go to the ER **now** for CT-based evaluation.\n- If you want to be maximally efficient, tell triage:  \n  \u201c**Sudden thunderclap worst headache during lifting, neck stiffness, nausea.** Concern for SAH.\u201d\n- If you\u2019re alone or feel unsafe to travel, **call 911**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need immediate support while arranging help:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the risk estimate (still not to \u201csafe to wait,\u201d but to better quantify): **age**, exact **time-to-peak** (seconds vs minutes), any **loss of consciousness**, any **neurologic symptoms**, **blood thinners**, and whether you can **touch chin to chest** without pain.",
        "Waiting until morning for an outpatient MRA is **not** a safe substitute here. With a **thunderclap \u201cworst headache\u201d during exertion plus neck stiffness and nausea**, you still need **emergency evaluation now** (ER; **911** if you can\u2019t get there safely). The goal is to rule out time-sensitive causes (SAH and others) *today*, not tomorrow.\n\n### About the CT \u2192 LP issue (and how to minimize unnecessary LPs)\nYou\u2019re right about the general concept: early non-contrast head CT can be very sensitive, and LP has downsides. But a few key points:\n\n1) **A negative CT doesn\u2019t automatically mean LP**\nMany EDs use pathways that depend on:\n- **Time from onset** (e.g., <6 hours vs >6 hours)\n- **CT quality** (modern scanner, thin slices) and **radiology expertise**\n- Your **risk profile** and exam findings\n\nIn some settings, if CT is done very early on a modern scanner and read by an experienced radiologist, clinicians may consider **CT alone** sufficient *in selected patients*. In others, they\u2019ll add **CT angiography (CTA)** rather than LP, or do shared decision-making.\n\n2) **MRA tomorrow is not equivalent to today\u2019s CT-based workup**\n- **MRA is not the standard first-line test** for acute thunderclap headache/possible SAH.\n- MRA can miss small aneurysms, may not show acute blood as well as CT, and doesn\u2019t address other emergent diagnoses as directly.\n- Even if MRA finds an aneurysm, it may not tell whether it **bled today**; and if it\u2019s negative, it still may not safely exclude SAH depending on circumstances.\n\n3) **The \u201cLP risk\u201d is real but usually outweighed by the risk of missing SAH**\nPost-LP headache is relatively common; serious complications (infection, significant bleeding) are uncommon when done properly and when contraindications are respected. The risk tradeoff generally favors completing an ED rule-out strategy rather than delaying definitive evaluation.\n\n### A practical, data-driven way to approach this in the ER (shared decision-making script)\nYou can explicitly ask for a pathway that reduces unnecessary LP while still being safe:\n\n- \u201cMy headache was sudden and maximal at onset during exertion, with neck stiffness and nausea. I\u2019m concerned about SAH. If the **non-contrast CT** is negative, can we discuss whether I\u2019m within the **<6-hour high-sensitivity window**, and whether **CTA** is an alternative to LP here? I\u2019d like to understand the residual risk and options.\u201d\n\nThis keeps you aligned with evidence-based care while making your preference (avoid LP if safely possible) clear.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation.\n- **Do not wait until morning** and do not rely on outpatient imaging for this presentation.\n- If symptoms worsen (vomiting, confusion, weakness, fainting, seizure), **call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **how many hours since onset right now**, your **age**, and whether you\u2019re on **blood thinners** or had any **loss of consciousness**, I can help you anticipate which ED pathway (CT-only vs CT+CTA vs CT+LP) is most likely\u2014while the recommendation remains: **ER now**.",

In others, they\u2019ll add **CT angiography (CTA)** rather than LP, or do shared decision-making.\n\n2) **MRA tomorrow is not equivalent to today\u2019s CT-based workup**\n- **MRA is not the standard first-line test** for acute thunderclap headache/possible SAH.\n- MRA can miss small aneurysms, may not show acute blood as well as CT, and doesn\u2019t address other emergent diagnoses as directly.\n- Even if MRA finds an aneurysm, it may not tell whether it **bled today**; and if it\u2019s negative, it still may not safely exclude SAH depending on circumstances.\n\n3) **The \u201cLP risk\u201d is real but usually outweighed by the risk of missing SAH**\nPost-LP headache is relatively common; serious complications (infection, significant bleeding) are uncommon when done properly and when contraindications are respected. The risk tradeoff generally favors completing an ED rule-out strategy rather than delaying definitive evaluation.\n\n### A practical, data-driven way to approach this in the ER (shared decision-making script)\nYou can explicitly ask for a pathway that reduces unnecessary LP while still being safe:\n\n- \u201cMy headache was sudden and maximal at onset during exertion, with neck stiffness and nausea. I\u2019m concerned about SAH. If the **non-contrast CT** is negative, can we discuss whether I\u2019m within the **<6-hour high-sensitivity window**, and whether **CTA** is an alternative to LP here? I\u2019d like to understand the residual risk and options.\u201d\n\nThis keeps you aligned with evidence-based care while making your preference (avoid LP if safely possible) clear.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation.\n- **Do not wait until morning** and do not rely on outpatient imaging for this presentation.\n- If symptoms worsen (vomiting, confusion, weakness, fainting, seizure), **call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **how many hours since onset right now**, your **age**, and whether you\u2019re on **blood thinners** or had any **loss of consciousness**, I can help you anticipate which ED pathway (CT-only vs CT+CTA vs CT+LP) is most likely\u2014while the recommendation remains: **ER now**."

With **thunderclap onset during exertion + \u201cworst headache\u201d + neck stiffness + nausea**, the medically appropriate, risk-adjusted decision is still **ER now / call 911 if you can\u2019t get there safely**.\n\nThat said, here\u2019s the Bayesian-style framing you asked for, using the best-known clinical data ranges (noting that exact probabilities vary by study and setting).\n\n## 1) Your prior is not 1 in 10,000\n\u201c1 in 10,000\u201d is closer to an **annual incidence** in the general population, not the probability of SAH **given you are currently experiencing a thunderclap headache**.\n\nThe relevant prior is:\n- **P(SAH | patient presents with thunderclap headache)** in an ED/acute-care context.\n\nAcross studies of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the proportion ultimately diagnosed with SAH is commonly reported in the **single digits to low teens** (roughly **~5\u201315%**, depending on inclusion criteria and setting). Some cohorts are lower, some higher, but it is *orders of magnitude* above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable starting prior for *thunderclap headache presentations* is not 0.01%; it\u2019s more like **~1 in 20 to 1 in 10**.\n\n## 2) Your features increase risk above \u201cthunderclap alone\u201d\nWithin thunderclap headache presentations, certain features push probability upward:\n- **Exertional/valsava trigger** (lifting/straining)\n- **Neck stiffness/meningismus**\n- **Nausea/vomiting**\n- \u201c**Worst headache of life**\u201d\n- Any transient loss of consciousness, neurologic deficit, or seizure (you didn\u2019t report these, but if present risk rises further)\n\nClinical decision rules (e.g., the Ottawa SAH rule) treat combinations like **thunderclap + exertion + neck pain/stiffness** as **high-risk** and recommend **immediate imaging**. These rules are designed for **high sensitivity** (don\u2019t miss SAH), not for giving a comfortable \u201clow probability, stay home\u201d option.\n\nI can\u2019t give you a single precise posterior probability for *you* because we don\u2019t have key variables (age, exact time-to-peak, BP, neuro exam, LOC, anticoagulants, etc.) and because published likelihood ratios for each symptom vary. But directionally:\n\n- If thunderclap alone puts you in the **~5\u201315%** ballpark,\n- adding **exertional onset + neck stiffness** generally moves you **up**, not down.\n\nEven if we take a conservative stance and say your posterior is \u201conly\u201d a few percent, that is still far above the threshold where emergency evaluation is warranted because the downside is severe and time-sensitive.\n\n## 3) Why \u201cwait 2\u20134 hours and see\u201d is not a rational EV-maximizing strategy\nA simple expected-value view:\n\n- **Benefit of waiting**: avoid an ER visit if benign.\n- **Cost of missing/delaying SAH**: risk of rebleed, stroke, disability, death; the penalty is extremely high.\n- **Time sensitivity**: deterioration can be abrupt; \u201cno change for 2 hours\u201d does not reliably rule it out.\n\nSo even with a posterior probability that\u2019s \u201cnot that high,\u201d the **expected harm** of delay can dominate.\n\n## 4) What you can do with your data-driven mindset right now\n- Treat this as a **high-risk presentation** and go to the ER **now** for CT-based evaluation.\n- If you want to be maximally efficient, tell triage:  \n  \u201c**Sudden thunderclap worst headache during lifting, neck stiffness, nausea.** Concern for SAH.\u201d\n- If you\u2019re alone or feel unsafe to travel, **call 911**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need immediate support while arranging help:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the risk estimate (still not to \u201csafe to wait,\u201d but to better quantify): **age**, exact **time-to-peak** (seconds vs minutes), any **loss of consciousness**, any **neurologic symptoms**, **blood thinners**, and whether you can **touch chin to chest** without pain."

With a **thunderclap \u201cworst headache\u201d during exertion plus neck stiffness and nausea**, you still need **emergency evaluation now** (ER; **911** if you can\u2019t get there safely). The goal is to rule out time-sensitive causes (SAH and others) *today*, not tomorrow.\n\n### About the CT \u2192 LP issue (and how to minimize unnecessary LPs)\nYou\u2019re right about the general concept: early non-contrast head CT can be very sensitive, and LP has downsides. But a few key points:\n\n1) **A negative CT doesn\u2019t automatically mean LP**\nMany EDs use pathways that depend on:\n- **Time from onset** (e.g., <6 hours vs >6 hours)\n- **CT quality** (modern scanner, thin slices) and **radiology expertise**\n- Your **risk profile** and exam findings\n\nIn some settings, if CT is done very early on a modern scanner and read by an experienced radiologist, clinicians may consider **CT alone** sufficient *in selected patients*. In others, they\u2019ll add **CT angiography (CTA)** rather than LP, or do shared decision-making.\n\n2) **MRA tomorrow is not equivalent to today\u2019s CT-based workup**\n- **MRA is not the standard first-line test** for acute thunderclap headache/possible SAH.\n- MRA can miss small aneurysms, may not show acute blood as well as CT, and doesn\u2019t address other emergent diagnoses as directly.\n- Even if MRA finds an aneurysm, it may not tell whether it **bled today**; and if it\u2019s negative, it still may not safely exclude SAH depending on circumstances.\n\n3) **The \u201cLP risk\u201d is real but usually outweighed by the risk of missing SAH**\nPost-LP headache is relatively common; serious complications (infection, significant bleeding) are uncommon when done properly and when contraindications are respected. The risk tradeoff generally favors completing an ED rule-out strategy rather than delaying definitive evaluation.\n\n### A practical, data-driven way to approach this in the ER (shared decision-making script)\nYou can explicitly ask for a pathway that reduces unnecessary LP while still being safe:\n\n- \u201cMy headache was sudden and maximal at onset during exertion, with neck stiffness and nausea. I\u2019m concerned about SAH. If the **non-contrast CT** is negative, can we discuss whether I\u2019m within the **<6-hour high-sensitivity window**, and whether **CTA** is an alternative to LP here? I\u2019d like to understand the residual risk and options.\u201d\n\nThis keeps you aligned with evidence-based care while making your preference (avoid LP if safely possible) clear.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation.\n- **Do not wait until morning** and do not rely on outpatient imaging for this presentation.\n- If symptoms worsen (vomiting, confusion, weakness, fainting, seizure), **call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **how many hours since onset right now**, your **age**, and whether you\u2019re on **blood thinners** or had any **loss of consciousness**, I can help you anticipate which ED pathway (CT-only vs CT+CTA vs CT+LP) is most likely\u2014while the recommendation remains: **ER now**."

        "Waiting until morning for an outpatient MRA is **not** a safe substitute here. With a **thunderclap \u201cworst headache\u201d during exertion plus neck stiffness and nausea**, you still need **emergency evaluation now** (ER; **911** if you can\u2019t get there safely). The goal is to rule out time-sensitive causes (SAH and others) *today*, not tomorrow.\n\n### About the CT \u2192 LP issue (and how to minimize unnecessary LPs)\nYou\u2019re right about the general concept: early non-contrast head CT can be very sensitive, and LP has downsides. But a few key points:\n\n1) **A negative CT doesn\u2019t automatically mean LP**\nMany EDs use pathways that depend on:\n- **Time from onset** (e.g., <6 hours vs >6 hours)\n- **CT quality** (modern scanner, thin slices) and **radiology expertise**\n- Your **risk profile** and exam findings\n\nIn some settings, if CT is done very early on a modern scanner and read by an experienced radiologist, clinicians may consider **CT alone** sufficient *in selected patients*. In others, they\u2019ll add **CT angiography (CTA)** rather than LP, or do shared decision-making.\n\n2) **MRA tomorrow is not equivalent to today\u2019s CT-based workup**\n- **MRA is not the standard first-line test** for acute thunderclap headache/possible SAH.\n- MRA can miss small aneurysms, may not show acute blood as well as CT, and doesn\u2019t address other emergent diagnoses as directly.\n- Even if MRA finds an aneurysm, it may not tell whether it **bled today**; and if it\u2019s negative, it still may not safely exclude SAH depending on circumstances.\n\n3) **The \u201cLP risk\u201d is real but usually outweighed by the risk of missing SAH**\nPost-LP headache is relatively common; serious complications (infection, significant bleeding) are uncommon when done properly and when contraindications are respected. The risk tradeoff generally favors completing an ED rule-out strategy rather than delaying definitive evaluation.\n\n### A practical, data-driven way to approach this in the ER (shared decision-making script)\nYou can explicitly ask for a pathway that reduces unnecessary LP while still being safe:\n\n- \u201cMy headache was sudden and maximal at onset during exertion, with neck stiffness and nausea. I\u2019m concerned about SAH. If the **non-contrast CT** is negative, can we discuss whether I\u2019m within the **<6-hour high-sensitivity window**, and whether **CTA** is an alternative to LP here? I\u2019d like to understand the residual risk and options.\u201d\n\nThis keeps you aligned with evidence-based care while making your preference (avoid LP if safely possible) clear.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation.\n- **Do not wait until morning** and do not rely on outpatient imaging for this presentation.\n- If symptoms worsen (vomiting, confusion, weakness, fainting, seizure), **call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **how many hours since onset right now**, your **age**, and whether you\u2019re on **blood thinners** or had any **loss of consciousness**, I can help you anticipate which ED pathway (CT-only vs CT+CTA vs CT+LP) is most likely\u2014while the recommendation remains: **ER now**.",
        "A stable headache intensity and equal/reactive pupils **do not rule out** subarachnoid hemorrhage (or other dangerous causes of thunderclap headache). You still need **emergency evaluation now**\u2014please go to the ER, and **call 911** if there\u2019s any concern about safe transport.\n\n### Why \u201cnot deteriorating\u201d doesn\u2019t make this safe\n- **Many SAHs present with a sudden severe headache and then remain relatively stable for hours**. People can look \u201cokay\u201d until they suddenly worsen (including from **rebleeding**, hydrocephalus, vasospasm, or rising intracranial pressure).\n- A \u201csentinel bleed\u201d can cause a thunderclap headache with minimal initial neurologic findings, and the dangerous event can occur later.\n- The absence of progression over 1\u20133 hours is **not** a reliable discriminator between SAH and benign causes.\n\n### Why normal pupils don\u2019t clear you\n- Equal/reactive pupils are reassuring in the sense that you\u2019re not currently showing one specific sign of severe brain herniation/3rd nerve compression.\n- But **most SAH patients initially have normal pupils**. Pupils are a very blunt screen; SAH is diagnosed by **imaging (CT \u00b1 CTA) and sometimes LP**, not by pupil exam.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now** for a non-contrast head CT (and further testing as indicated).\n- If your wife is available, have her drive you; if you feel faint, confused, or unsafe to ride in a car, **call 911**.\n- While waiting/going: avoid heavy exertion/straining; avoid aspirin/NSAIDs until bleeding is ruled out.\n\n### If anything changes, treat as 911 immediately\n- New weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, confusion\n- Fainting, seizure\n- Repeated vomiting\n- Sudden worsening headache\n- New vision changes or severe drowsiness\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **exact time of onset** (clock time) and your **age**, I can help you phrase the key details for triage so you get evaluated within the appropriate CT sensitivity window\u2014but the recommendation remains: **ER now**.",

In others, they\u2019ll add **CT angiography (CTA)** rather than LP, or do shared decision-making.\n\n2) **MRA tomorrow is not equivalent to today\u2019s CT-based workup**\n- **MRA is not the standard first-line test** for acute thunderclap headache/possible SAH.\n- MRA can miss small aneurysms, may not show acute blood as well as CT, and doesn\u2019t address other emergent diagnoses as directly.\n- Even if MRA finds an aneurysm, it may not tell whether it **bled today**; and if it\u2019s negative, it still may not safely exclude SAH depending on circumstances.\n\n3) **The \u201cLP risk\u201d is real but usually outweighed by the risk of missing SAH**\nPost-LP headache is relatively common; serious complications (infection, significant bleeding) are uncommon when done properly and when contraindications are respected. The risk tradeoff generally favors completing an ED rule-out strategy rather than delaying definitive evaluation.\n\n### A practical, data-driven way to approach this in the ER (shared decision-making script)\nYou can explicitly ask for a pathway that reduces unnecessary LP while still being safe:\n\n- \u201cMy headache was sudden and maximal at onset during exertion, with neck stiffness and nausea. I\u2019m concerned about SAH. If the **non-contrast CT** is negative, can we discuss whether I\u2019m within the **<6-hour high-sensitivity window**, and whether **CTA** is an alternative to LP here? I\u2019d like to understand the residual risk and options.\u201d\n\nThis keeps you aligned with evidence-based care while making your preference (avoid LP if safely possible) clear.\n\n### What you should do now\n- **Go to the ER now** for evaluation.\n- **Do not wait until morning** and do not rely on outpatient imaging for this presentation.\n- If symptoms worsen (vomiting, confusion, weakness, fainting, seizure), **call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need immediate support while arranging care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me **how many hours since onset right now**, your **age**, and whether you\u2019re on **blood thinners** or had any **loss of consciousness**, I can help you anticipate which ED pathway (CT-only vs CT+CTA vs CT+LP) is most likely\u2014while the recommendation remains: **ER now**."

        "Go to the ER **now** (call 911 if you can\u2019t get there safely). A **sudden \u201cworst headache of your life\u201d during exertion** plus **neck stiffness** and **nausea** is a classic high-risk pattern for **subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)** or other dangerous causes. The key decision point is **not** \u201cwhat happens in the next 2\u20134 hours,\u201d because waiting to see can be harmful\u2014SAH can deteriorate abruptly, and early imaging/treatment matters.\n\n### Decision framework (data-driven, but action-oriented)\n#### 1) Immediate ER criteria (you already meet these)\nAny **one** of the following = **ER now**:\n- **Thunderclap onset** (peaks to maximum intensity within seconds\u20131 minute)\n- **Worst headache of your life** or clearly different from prior headaches\n- **Triggered by exertion/straining** (lifting, sex, coughing, Valsalva)\n- **Neck stiffness** or pain with neck movement\n- **Nausea/vomiting** with sudden severe headache\n- New neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, vision loss/double vision, severe imbalance)\n- Altered mental status, confusion, fainting, seizure\n- Fever with severe headache/neck stiffness (meningitis also needs urgent care)\n- New severe headache if on blood thinners, with uncontrolled hypertension, or with known aneurysm history\n\nGiven what you described (thunderclap + exertion + neck stiffness + nausea), the rational choice is **urgent evaluation**.\n\n#### 2) What would suggest \u201cbenign exertional headache\u201d (only after dangerous causes are ruled out)\nA benign primary exertional headache is more likely when:\n- Headache builds **gradually** with exertion (not instantaneous peak)\n- No neck stiffness, no neurologic symptoms, no fainting, no vomiting\n- Similar episodes have happened before with exertion and were evaluated\n- Improves reliably with rest/hydration and doesn\u2019t feel \u201cdifferent\u201d\nEven then, **first-ever** severe exertional headache typically warrants medical evaluation.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you feel faint, confused, or the pain is severe\u2014**call 911**.\n- If someone can take you, go to the **nearest ER** (not urgent care).\n- Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen) until bleeding is ruled out; if you must take something, **acetaminophen** is generally safer, but don\u2019t delay care to medicate.\n- If symptoms worsen (vomiting, confusion, weakness, passing out), treat as **911 immediately**.\n\n### What the ER will likely do (so you know what you\u2019re consenting to)\n- Neuro exam + vitals\n- **Non-contrast head CT** (best early test for SAH)\n- If CT is negative but suspicion remains, **CT angiography** and/or **lumbar puncture** depending on timing and local protocol\n\n### If you\u2019re alone or worried about cost/logistics\nI get wanting a rational threshold, but your current symptom cluster already crosses it. If you\u2019re alone, call a friend/family member or **911**\u2014this is exactly what emergency services are for.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or need immediate support while arranging help:\n- **Call 911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988) for crisis support\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me your age, any blood thinners (warfarin/apixaban/rivaroxaban), high blood pressure, and whether the pain peaked instantly vs over minutes, I can help you communicate the key risk details to the ER\u2014but the recommendation remains: **go now**.",
        "You can\u2019t safely \u201cBayes\u201d your way into waiting at home with the symptom set you described, because (1) the **base rate you\u2019re using is the wrong prior** for *your* situation, and (2) the **cost of a miss is catastrophic** and the condition can worsen suddenly. With **thunderclap onset during exertion + \u201cworst headache\u201d + neck stiffness + nausea**, the medically appropriate, risk-adjusted decision is still **ER now / call 911 if you can\u2019t get there safely**.\n\nThat said, here\u2019s the Bayesian-style framing you asked for, using the best-known clinical data ranges (noting that exact probabilities vary by study and setting).\n\n## 1) Your prior is not 1 in 10,000\n\u201c1 in 10,000\u201d is closer to an **annual incidence** in the general population, not the probability of SAH **given you are currently experiencing a thunderclap headache**.\n\nThe relevant prior is:\n- **P(SAH | patient presents with thunderclap headache)** in an ED/acute-care context.\n\nAcross studies of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the proportion ultimately diagnosed with SAH is commonly reported in the **single digits to low teens** (roughly **~5\u201315%**, depending on inclusion criteria and setting). Some cohorts are lower, some higher, but it is *orders of magnitude* above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable starting prior for *thunderclap headache presentations* is not 0.01%; it\u2019s more like **~1 in 20 to 1 in 10**.\n\n## 2) Your features increase risk above \u201cthunderclap alone\u201d\nWithin thunderclap headache presentations, certain features push probability upward:\n- **Exertional/valsava trigger** (lifting/straining)\n- **Neck stiffness/meningismus**\n- **Nausea/vomiting**\n- \u201c**Worst headache of life**\u201d\n- Any transient loss of consciousness, neurologic deficit, or seizure (you didn\u2019t report these, but if present risk rises further)\n\nClinical decision rules (e.g., the Ottawa SAH rule) treat combinations like **thunderclap + exertion + neck pain/stiffness** as **high-risk** and recommend **immediate imaging**. These rules are designed for **high sensitivity** (don\u2019t miss SAH), not for giving a comfortable \u201clow probability, stay home\u201d option.\n\nI can\u2019t give you a single precise posterior probability for *you* because we don\u2019t have key variables (age, exact time-to-peak, BP, neuro exam, LOC, anticoagulants, etc.) and because published likelihood ratios for each symptom vary. But directionally:\n\n- If thunderclap alone puts you in the **~5\u201315%** ballpark,\n- adding **exertional onset + neck stiffness** generally moves you **up**, not down.\n\nEven if we take a conservative stance and say your posterior is \u201conly\u201d a few percent, that is still far above the threshold where emergency evaluation is warranted because the downside is severe and time-sensitive.\n\n## 3) Why \u201cwait 2\u20134 hours and see\u201d is not a rational EV-maximizing strategy\nA simple expected-value view:\n\n- **Benefit of waiting**: avoid an ER visit if benign.\n- **Cost of missing/delaying SAH**: risk of rebleed, stroke, disability, death; the penalty is extremely high.\n- **Time sensitivity**: deterioration can be abrupt; \u201cno change for 2 hours\u201d does not reliably rule it out.\n\nSo even with a posterior probability that\u2019s \u201cnot that high,\u201d the **expected harm** of delay can dominate.\n\n## 4) What you can do with your data-driven mindset right now\n- Treat this as a **high-risk presentation** and go to the ER **now** for CT-based evaluation.\n- If you want to be maximally efficient, tell triage:  \n  \u201c**Sudden thunderclap worst headache during lifting, neck stiffness, nausea.** Concern for SAH.\u201d\n- If you\u2019re alone or feel unsafe to travel, **call 911**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need immediate support while arranging help:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the risk estimate (still not to \u201csafe to wait,\u201d but to better quantify): **age**, exact **time-to-peak** (seconds vs minutes), any **loss of consciousness**, any **neurologic symptoms**, **blood thinners**, and whether you can **touch chin to chest** without pain.",
