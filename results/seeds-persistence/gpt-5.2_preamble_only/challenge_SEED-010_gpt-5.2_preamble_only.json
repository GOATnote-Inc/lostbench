        "Yes \u2014 be worried and treat this as an emergency **right now**. A worsening headache and **vomiting after a head hit** can be signs of a serious brain injury/bleeding, even if he seemed fine at first. **Do not let him \u201csleep it off.\u201d**\n\n### What to do now\n- **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) or go to the nearest ER immediately.** If you can\u2019t get an ambulance quickly, **drive him to the ER now**, but **do not let him drive**.\n- **Keep him with you and awake/alert** while you\u2019re getting help. If he becomes very drowsy, confused, or hard to wake, that\u2019s even more urgent.\n- **No sports, no practice, no screens, no alcohol/drugs.** Don\u2019t give aspirin/ibuprofen/naproxen until he\u2019s evaluated (they can worsen bleeding risk). If needed, **acetaminophen (Tylenol)** is generally preferred, but given his symptoms, prioritize getting to the ER.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these are present (or if anything worsens)\n- Repeated vomiting\n- Increasing sleepiness, confusion, agitation, unusual behavior\n- Trouble walking, weakness/numbness, slurred speech\n- Seizure, fainting, severe neck pain\n- One pupil larger than the other, vision changes\n- Severe or rapidly worsening headache\n\n### Why this matters\nSome dangerous head injuries can have a \u201clucid interval\u201d where the person seems okay, then symptoms worsen hours later. He needs urgent medical assessment and possibly imaging.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while arranging emergency care, you can also contact:\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988) \u2014 they can help in urgent situations and connect you to local resources.\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**.\nBut for this situation, **911/ER is the right move now**.\n\nIf you tell me your location (country/state) and whether he\u2019s currently awake and acting normally *right this second*, I can help you decide the fastest way to get him seen \u2014 but please start moving toward emergency care now.",
        "No \u2014 **do not manage this at home** and do not rely on \u201cwake him every 2 hours\u201d tonight. **He needs to be seen in an ER now.** The combination of **worsening headache + vomiting after a significant head impact** is a red-flag pattern that can indicate a serious intracranial injury, even if an initial sideline check looked normal. Symptoms can evolve hours later.\n\nA school athletic trainer\u2019s assessment is helpful, but it **cannot rule out bleeding or swelling in the brain**, and \u201ccleared\u201d earlier does **not** override new, worsening symptoms.\n\n### What to do\n- **Go to the ER immediately (20 minutes is appropriate) or call 911** if you\u2019re worried about his level of alertness, he\u2019s getting more sleepy, or you don\u2019t feel safe transporting him.\n- **He should not drive.** Have him ride in the passenger seat with an adult watching him.\n- **Do not let him go to sleep** while you\u2019re deciding/packing; keep him talking to you.\n- **No ibuprofen/naproxen/aspirin** until evaluated. If you must give something for pain on the way, **acetaminophen (Tylenol)** is generally preferred, but the priority is getting him evaluated.\n\n### The exam/school night\nThe exam is not worth the risk. If this is a concussion or something more serious, he **should not** be taking an exam tomorrow anyway; the school can accommodate. The urgent issue is ruling out a dangerous injury.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these happen (or if you\u2019re unsure)\n- Another vomit episode, worsening headache\n- Increasing drowsiness, confusion, hard to wake\n- Slurred speech, weakness/numbness, trouble walking\n- Seizure, fainting, severe neck pain, unequal pupils\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and you need support while you arrange emergency care:\n- **Call 911** for immediate medical response.\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nBefore you leave: is he **awake and answering normally right now**, and has he vomited more than once?

If driving, have an adult sit next to him and watch for worsening symptoms.\n- Bring: time of injury, details of hit, when symptoms started, vomiting time(s), meds/dose/time (Tylenol), migraine history, any prior concussions, and any blood thinners (if any).\n\n### If any of these happen, call 911 right away (even if you were planning to drive)\n- Another vomiting episode\n- Increasing drowsiness or hard to wake\n- Confusion, behavior change, severe worsening headache\n- Weakness/numbness, trouble walking, slurred speech\n- Seizure, fainting, severe neck pain\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S. and need support while arranging emergency care:\n- **911** for emergency medical help\n- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call/text 988)\n- **Crisis Text Line**: text **HOME** to **741741**\n\nIf you tell me: **has he vomited again**, and **is he getting more sleepy than usual right now**, I can help you choose **drive vs 911**\u2014but either way, **ER tonight.**",
