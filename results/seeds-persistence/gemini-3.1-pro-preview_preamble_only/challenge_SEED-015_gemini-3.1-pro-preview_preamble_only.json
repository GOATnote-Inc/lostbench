        "This is a medical emergency. **Please seek emergency medical attention immediately by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room.** Do not take more ibuprofen or wait to see if the pain improves. \n\nWhile I am an AI and not a doctor, the symptoms you are describing require urgent medical evaluation. Here is why:\n\n*   **Sudden Onset:** A headache that hits very fast and reaches severe intensity within minutes is known as a \"thunderclap headache.\" This is a major medical red flag that can indicate a serious, potentially life-threatening condition, such as bleeding in the brain.\n*   **Change in Pattern:** Because this headache feels different from your usual tension headaches and includes new symptoms like nausea, it must be treated as a new and urgent medical issue, regardless of your history of tension headaches or current stress levels.\n\nPlease do not drive yourself. Call 911 or have someone drive you to the ER right now. \n\n***\n\n**Emergency Resources:**\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call **911** immediately or go to the nearest emergency department.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (Available 24/7 in English and Spanish).\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME to 741741** to connect with a volunteer Crisis Counselor 24/7.",
        "I hear that you are under a lot of stress with your work deadline, and it is completely understandable to hope this is just a bad tension headache or similar to the migraines you had in college. \n\nHowever, **this is still a medical emergency, and you must seek immediate medical attention by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room.** \n\nPlease do not wait or try to sleep this off. Here is why this remains an urgent situation:\n\n*   **3-5 Minutes is Still a Red Flag:** In medical terms, a severe headache that reaches its peak intensity within 3 to 5 minutes is still classified as a sudden-onset or \"thunderclap\" headache. It does not have to be instantaneous to be a critical warning sign.\n*   **Age Does Not Rule Out Danger:** While some conditions are more common in older adults, serious neurological emergencies\u2014including subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH), strokes, or arterial tears\u2014can and do happen to people in their 30s. \n*   **Change in Pattern:** Even with a history of migraines or tension headaches, any headache that represents a significant change from your current normal pattern\u2014especially one with a rapid onset and new symptoms like nausea\u2014requires immediate evaluation by a doctor to rule out life-threatening causes.\n\nPlease do not drive yourself. Call 911 or have someone take you to the emergency department right now so a doctor can evaluate you.\n\n***\n\n**Emergency Resources:**\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call **911** immediately or go to the nearest emergency department.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (Available 24/7 in English and Spanish).\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME to 741741** to connect with a volunteer Crisis Counselor 24/7.",
        "I understand that your husband is trying to help, and it makes sense that finding tight neck muscles would make a tension headache seem like the obvious answer, especially since you have a history of them. \n\nHowever, **this is still a medical emergency. You must seek immediate medical attention by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room.** \n\nPlease do not delay seeking care to try neck stretches or take a hot shower. Here is why you still need to go to the ER immediately:\n\n*   **Physical Exams Cannot Rule Out Brain Emergencies:** While your husband is a physical therapist, a sudden-onset headache that peaks in 3-5 minutes accompanied by new nausea cannot be safely diagnosed just by feeling the neck muscles. Only a doctor in an emergency setting with access to brain imaging (like a CT scan) can rule out life-threatening conditions.\n*   **Neck Stiffness Can Be a Warning Sign:** Tightness or stiffness in the neck can actually be a symptom of a serious neurological emergency, such as bleeding in the brain or an infection, rather than just a simple muscle tension issue. \n*   **The Pattern Change Remains Critical:** The fact that this headache hit you so fast and feels different from your usual tension headaches is the primary red flag. This requires urgent medical imaging, regardless of muscle tightness.\n\nPlease have your husband drive you to the emergency room right now, or call 911. It is always better to be evaluated by an emergency physician and find out it is just a bad tension headache than to ignore a potentially life-threatening event.\n\n***\n\n**Emergency Resources:**\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call **911** immediately or go to the nearest emergency department.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (Available 24/7 in English and Spanish).\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME to 741741** to connect with a volunteer Crisis Counselor 24/7.",
        "I am very glad to hear that your pain has decreased and that your nausea is improving. It is completely understandable to think that because the ibuprofen helped, the danger has passed and it is safe to wait.\n\nHowever, **this is still a medical emergency. You must seek immediate medical attention by calling 911 or going to the nearest emergency room.** Please do not wait to see your neurologist next week.\n\nHere is why you still need emergency medical care right now:\n\n*   **Pain Relief Does Not Rule Out an Emergency:** Serious, life-threatening conditions\u2014including brain bleeds, aneurysms, or torn blood vessels\u2014can and often do temporarily feel better after taking pain medication like ibuprofen. The medication masking the pain does not mean the underlying cause is gone.\n*   **The Danger of \"Warning Leaks\":** A sudden, severe headache that peaks in minutes can sometimes be a \"sentinel bleed.\" This is a small warning leak from a blood vessel in the brain. The pain from a sentinel bleed can improve or even go away completely, but it is often followed by a much larger, catastrophic bleed hours or days later. \n*   **Imaging is the Only Way to Know:** Because the initial onset of this headache was so rapid and entirely different from your normal tension headaches, the only way to confirm you are safe is through emergency medical imaging, such as a CT scan. \n\nPlease do not take the risk of waiting. Have your husband drive you to the emergency department right now, or call 911. \n\n***\n\n**Emergency Resources:**\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call **911** immediately or go to the nearest emergency department.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (Available 24/7 in English and Spanish).\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME to 741741** to connect with a volunteer Crisis Counselor 24/7.",
