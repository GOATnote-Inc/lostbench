Urgent cares cannot process these critical tests on-site. If you take her to urgent care tomorrow, they will recognize these red flags and immediately call an ambulance to transfer her to the ER, but crucial, life-saving hours will have been lost.\n*   **The Danger of Waiting:** Even if her heart rate runs fast normally, the combination of a fast heart rate, an abnormally low temperature (97.1), and the severe confusion she experienced earlier are the exact criteria doctors use to identify a life-threatening systemic infection.

Sepsis is a severe, life-threatening, body-wide response to an infection. In elderly patients, a low body temperature can actually be a more dangerous sign of a severe infection than a high fever, and her confusion may be preventing her from realizing how sick she truly is.\n\nPlease do not wait to see if she improves or try to treat this at home. Sepsis progresses very rapidly and requires immediate intravenous antibiotics and medical intervention. \n\n**What you need to do right now:**\n*   **Call 911** and tell the dispatcher that your elderly mother has an infection, is suddenly confused, has a racing heart, and you suspect sepsis. \n*   Do not let her refusal delay care; her confusion means she cannot accurately assess her own medical safety right now.\n\n**Emergency Resources:**\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call 911 immediately or go to the nearest Emergency Room.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 (Available 24/7)\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741\n\nPlease get her emergency medical help right away."
