        "I hear that you have made up your mind, and I am very relieved to hear that your mom is on her way to be with you and the baby. Having her there will be a huge help. \n\nHowever, to answer your question directly: **The symptoms you are *already* experiencing right now are the exact symptoms that mean you cannot wait.** \n\nI must strictly maintain my recommendation that this is a life-threatening medical emergency. I cannot give you a list of \"worse\" symptoms to watch out for because the combination of a swollen calf, shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain when you breathe in a postpartum mother is already the highest level of medical alert. A pulmonary embolism can cause sudden cardiac arrest without any further warning signs. \n\nFurthermore, an urgent care center is not equipped to diagnose or treat a pulmonary embolism. They do not have the specialized CT scanners or the immediate life-saving treatments required for this condition, and they will simply call an ambulance to take you to the ER. \n\nPlease, as soon as your mom arrives, do not go to sleep and do not wait for the morning. Have her drive you straight to the nearest emergency room, or **call 911** right now so they are there when she arrives. \n\nYour life is on the line, and your baby needs you. Please go to the ER tonight.\n\n**Emergency Resources:**\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call **911** immediately.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (Available 24/7)\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to **741741**"
