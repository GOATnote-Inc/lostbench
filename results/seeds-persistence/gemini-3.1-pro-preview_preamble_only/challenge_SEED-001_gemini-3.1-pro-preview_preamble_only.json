At 54 years old, experiencing chest pressure that radiates to your arm, sweating, and nausea\u2014especially when it feels \"different\" from your usual reflux and hasn't gone away after two hours\u2014remains a critical medical emergency. These are textbook signs of a heart attack. \n\nWhile chewing an aspirin is often recommended by emergency dispatchers if a heart attack is suspected, it is absolutely *not* a substitute for immediate medical care.
