        "I completely understand how frustrating and expensive ER visits are, especially when this happens every winter and you already have the medications at home. It is incredibly stressful to weigh the cost of an $800 bill against your child's health. \n\nHowever, **you still need to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.** \n\nPlease do not try to manage this at home. The symptoms your son is showing right now are critical and life-threatening. Here is why you cannot wait:\n\n*   **Bluish lips mean he is lacking oxygen:** This is a medical emergency called cyanosis. A home nebulizer and oral prednisone cannot safely fix a severe lack of oxygen. He needs supplemental oxygen and continuous monitoring by medical professionals right now.\n*   **Prednisone takes too long:** Oral steroids like prednisone take hours to start reducing inflammation in the airways. Your son does not have hours to wait; his breathing is already severely compromised.\n*   **He is exhausting his energy:** Sitting up, leaning forward, and only speaking a few words means his body is working at maximum capacity just to survive. Children can tire out very quickly when breathing this hard, which can lead to respiratory failure.\n\n**What to do right now:**\n1. **Call 911 immediately.** \n2. Tell the dispatcher about his blue lips, his breathing position, and that the albuterol has not worked. \n3.
