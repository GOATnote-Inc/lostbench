This is a massive, urgent warning sign that a major, potentially devastating stroke could happen at any moment\u2014often within hours or days. \n* **Stop the Coffee Immediately:** **Please take the coffee away right now.** Because her speech has been slurred, the muscles she uses to swallow are likely impaired. Drinking liquids right now puts her at a severe risk of choking or inhaling fluid into her lungs (aspiration), which can be fatal. Do not give her any food, drink, or medication.\n* **Do Not Dismiss the Symptoms:** A glass of wine the night before or sleeping in a weird position does *not* cause slurred speech and unilateral clumsiness.
