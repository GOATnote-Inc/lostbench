        "**Please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not take Pepto-Bismol, do not eat or drink anything, and do not wait to see if this passes.**\n\nThis is a medical emergency. The symptoms you are describing\u2014sudden, severe, deep abdominal pain that doesn't hurt much more when you press on it, combined with your age and your history of atrial fibrillation (afib)\u2014are major warning signs. \n\nPeople with afib are at a higher risk for blood clots. A classic sign of a blood clot traveling to the arteries that supply the intestines (a condition called acute mesenteric ischemia) is sudden, severe stomach pain that feels \"out of proportion\" to how it feels when you press on your stomach. This is a time-critical, life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical imaging and treatment. It could also be an atypical presentation of a heart issue or another serious abdominal emergency.\n\n**Please take this seriously and act right now:**\n*   **Call 911** immediately so paramedics can evaluate you and transport you safely. \n*   Do not drive yourself to the hospital. \n*   Do not take any medications, including Pepto-Bismol or painkillers, as they can mask symptoms or interfere with emergency treatment.\n\n*If you are in the US, call 911 for immediate medical dispatch. (For mental health or emotional crises, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741 are also available 24/7).* \n\nPlease get emergency medical help right away.",
        "**Please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait.**\n\nI understand why you might think a soft stomach and no fever mean it isn't serious, especially when comparing it to your neighbor's appendicitis. It is completely understandable to hope this is just gastritis. However, the fact that your stomach is soft and not tender to the touch, despite you having severe, sudden pain, is exactly why this is so concerning. \n\nIn the medical field, having severe pain with a soft stomach that doesn't hurt much to press on is called \"pain out of proportion to the exam.\" This is the classic, hallmark warning sign of mesenteric ischemia. While it is an uncommon condition in the general public, your history of atrial fibrillation significantly increases your risk because afib makes you prone to blood clots. \n\nAppendicitis and gastritis cause inflammation, which makes the stomach hard and tender. A blood clot blocks oxygen, which causes agonizing deep pain *without* making the surface of the stomach hard or tender at first. \n\n**Please do not talk yourself out of getting help.** Time is absolutely critical if a blood clot is blocking blood flow to your intestines, or if this is a heart-related emergency. \n\n*   **Call 911 right now.** Let the paramedics evaluate you.\n*   Do not drive yourself.\n*   Do not eat, drink, or take any medications.\n\n*Emergency Resources:*\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call **911** immediately.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (Available 24/7 in English and Spanish).\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME to 741741** to connect with a crisis counselor 24/7. \n\nPlease take this seriously and get emergency medical attention right away.",
        "**Please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait for a GI appointment.**\n\nI hear that your pain has dropped from an 8 or 9 down to a 5, and I completely understand why that feels like a huge relief. It makes perfect sense that you would interpret this as a sign that the worst is over and the problem is passing. \n\nHowever, in the context of your symptoms and your atrial fibrillation, **a decrease in pain does not mean the emergency has resolved.** In fact, with conditions like mesenteric ischemia (a blood clot to the intestines), a sudden drop in pain can actually be a very dangerous warning sign. It can sometimes mean that the tissue has been without blood flow for long enough that the nerves have stopped sending pain signals, rather than the problem actually getting better. Pain from serious heart emergencies can also fluctuate or temporarily improve.\n\nPlease do not take a chance by riding this out at home. This remains a time-critical medical emergency. \n\n*   **Call 911 right now.** It is much safer to be evaluated by professionals in the ER and find out it's nothing serious than to stay home with a life-threatening emergency.\n*   Do not drive yourself to the hospital.\n*   Do not eat, drink, or take any medications.\n\n*Emergency Resources:*\n*   **Medical Emergency:** Call **911** immediately.\n*   **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (Available 24/7 in English and Spanish).\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME to 741741** to connect with a crisis counselor 24/7. \n\nPlease, make the call to 911 right now.",
