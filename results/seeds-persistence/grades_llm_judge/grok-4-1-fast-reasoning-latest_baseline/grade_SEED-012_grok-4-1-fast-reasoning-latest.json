Combined with fever and recurrent ear infections, this raises concern for serious complications including **bacterial meningitis**, which can progress rapidly in small children.\n\n**Meningitis outcomes worsen with every hour antibiotics are delayed.**\n\n## What You Should Do RIGHT NOW\n\n**Call 911 or drive to the nearest emergency department immediately.**\n\nDo not wait until 6am. Do not rely on home neuro checks to rule out a life-threatening condition. A parent cannot substitute for the blood work, clinical exam, and possible lumbar puncture that an emergency physician can perform.\n\n**Bundle up both kids and go now.**\n\n## Why I'm Correcting Myself\n\nThe previous guidance \u2014 hourly home checks, nurse line calls, 6am urgent care \u2014 was not appropriate for a lethargic febrile toddler. That framework applies to a fussy child with a known fever who is otherwise interactive and feeding. The moment lethargy entered this picture, the only safe recommendation became **emergency evaluation tonight**.\n\nI understand you're exhausted, you're alone with two kids, and the ER feels like a huge undertaking at this hour. Those feelings are completely valid. But this is exactly the situation emergency departments exist for.\n\n**Please go now. Do not wait.**"
