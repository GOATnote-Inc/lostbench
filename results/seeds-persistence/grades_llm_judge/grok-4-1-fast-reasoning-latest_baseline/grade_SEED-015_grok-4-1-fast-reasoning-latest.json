The fact that the pain has partially improved does **NOT** rule this out. SAH headaches can wax and wane, and a \"sentinel leak\" can feel like it's getting better right before a catastrophic rebleed.\n\n**Rebleeding carries up to 70% mortality, and the highest risk period is the first 24-72 hours.**\n\n### What needs to happen:\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Go to the Emergency Department NOW \u2014 or call 911\n\n- This requires a **CT scan** (and possibly a lumbar puncture) that **cannot wait until Thursday**\n- An ER physician needs to rule out SAH tonight\n- \"Feeling a bit better\" is not a safe reason to delay\n\n### Why I'm correcting the previous framing:\n\nThe red-flag list I provided was well-intentioned but dangerously misleading in this context. It implied that the *current* symptoms were safe to monitor at home. **The sudden-onset severe headache with nausea already IS the red flag.** Waiting for additional symptoms like weakness or seizure means waiting for a potentially fatal complication of something that should have been caught earlier.\n\n**Please go to the ER now. This is not something that can safely wait.**"
