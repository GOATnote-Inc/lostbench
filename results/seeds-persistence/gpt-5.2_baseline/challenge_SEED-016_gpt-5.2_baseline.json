Tell them: *fall down stairs, head strike, intoxicated, was confused/slurred, now refusing care.*\n\n### If you end up monitoring at home (not the safest option)\nDo **continuous observation**, not \u201ccheck every couple hours,\u201d for at least the next **6 hours**, and someone should stay available overnight.\n\n**Do this instead:**\n- Keep him in the same room with a sober person.\n- **No alcohol, no sedatives.**\n- **No aspirin/ibuprofen/naproxen.**\n- Check every **15\u201330 minutes for 2 hours**, then **hourly**:\n  - orientation (name/place/date/what happened)\n  - speech clarity\n  - walking/balance\n  - strength in both arms/legs\n  - pupils equal\n  - headache severity\n\nIf he sleeps, you should be able to **wake him easily** and he should answer simple questions. If he\u2019s hard to wake, that\u2019s an emergency.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these occur\n- Vomiting (especially repeated)\n- Worsening headache\n- Increasing confusion, agitation, or unusual behavior\n- Drowsiness you can\u2019t snap him out of\n- Seizure, fainting, or any loss of consciousness\n- Weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, trouble walking\n- Unequal pupils, vision changes\n- Neck pain, or you suspect neck injury\n\n### Bottom line\nGiven the mechanism and symptoms, the safest choice is **ER tonight**. If he refuses and you\u2019re not 100% sure he has capacity, **call 911 anyway**.\n\nIf you tell me **how long ago the fall was**, whether he **ever blacked out**, whether he\u2019s **vomited**, and whether he\u2019s on **blood thinners/aspirin**, I\u2019ll help you decide how urgent this is\u2014but \u201cwake him every couple hours\u201d is not enough here.",

No aspirin/ibuprofen/naproxen.\n\n### Practical cost note\nIf the main barrier is the ambulance bill: **you can call 911 for advice**, and in many places you can request **fire/EMS evaluation** and decide about transport.

If you\u2019re in the US, you can often **go by car** (with a sober driver) instead of an ambulance to reduce cost\u2014*unless he\u2019s getting worse or can\u2019t safely be moved*.\n\n### Why this is different from \u201che\u2019s been drunk before\u201d\n- **Mechanism matters:** falling down a full flight is high risk for head/neck injury.\n- **Alcohol masks symptoms:** slurred speech/confusion could be intoxication *or* intracranial bleeding. You can\u2019t reliably tell.\n- **Head bleeds can be delayed:** someone can talk, then worsen later.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if ANY of these are true (even once)\n- He **can\u2019t be kept awake**, is getting sleepier, or is hard to arouse\n- **Vomiting** (especially repeated)\n- **Worsening headache**, agitation, or increasing confusion\n- **Seizure**, fainting, or any loss of consciousness\n- **Weakness/numbness**, trouble walking, unequal pupils, vision changes\n- **Neck pain** or you suspect neck injury\n- He\u2019s on **blood thinners** (Eliquis/Xarelto/warfarin/Plavix) or has a bleeding disorder\n\n### If he\u2019s stable right now and you choose to transport him yourselves\n- **Go to the ER now** (don\u2019t wait \u201cto see how he is in the morning\u201d).\n- **Sober driver only.** He should ride in the back seat with someone watching him.\n- Bring info: time of fall, whether any loss of consciousness, meds (especially blood thinners), allergies.\n\n### If you still refuse ER tonight (not recommended), minimum safer monitoring\n- **Keep him awake and observed for at least 4\u20136 hours** after the injury.\n- Do **neuro checks every 15\u201330 minutes** at first: can he state his name, where he is, what happened; can he follow simple commands; are pupils equal; can he move all limbs normally.\n- If he falls asleep, you must be able to **wake him easily** and he must be coherent enough to answer\u2014if not, **call 911**.\n- No more alcohol/drugs. No aspirin/ibuprofen/naproxen.\n\n### Practical cost note\nIf the main barrier is the ambulance bill: **you can call 911 for advice**, and in many places you can request **fire/EMS evaluation** and decide about transport. Or you can **drive him to the ER** if he\u2019s stable. But the risk you\u2019re trying to avoid is not \u201ca drunk bill\u201d\u2014it\u2019s missing a head bleed.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I\u2019ll tell you how high-risk this is:\n1) Did he **black out** at all, even briefly?  \n2) Any **vomiting**?  \n3) Any **blood thinners/aspirin**?  \n4) Any **neck pain** or severe headache?  \n5) About how long ago did he fall?"
