People sometimes mistake it for a pulled muscle, and the pain can **ease after the initial event**, which does **not** make it safe.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these are present (even briefly)\n- Chest pain, neck/jaw pain, or pain moving to the back/abdomen\n- Shortness of breath, sweating, fainting, severe weakness\n- New numbness/weakness, trouble speaking/vision changes\n- One arm/leg feels cold, weak, or has a different pulse\n- New severe headache\n- You feel \u201cimpending doom\u201d or unusually unwell\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you feel unwell, dizzy, or the pain is significant\u2014**EMS is safer** and can start care en route.\n- **Avoid NSAIDs** (ibuprofen/naproxen) until you\u2019re evaluated, since they can affect blood pressure/kidneys and may complicate things.\n- Don\u2019t take a muscle relaxer to \u201csee if it passes\u201d before being checked\u2014masking symptoms can delay care.\n- If you were prescribed **lisinopril**, don\u2019t take extra doses to \u201ccatch up.\u201d Just tell the ER what you take and how often.\n\n### Why ER instead of \u201cwait and see\u201d\nMuscle strain is possible after shoveling, but **the combination of sudden tearing back pain + uncontrolled hypertension + never felt anything like this** is high\u2011risk and needs **immediate imaging and monitoring** to rule out dissection and other emergencies (heart attack, pulmonary embolism, etc.).
