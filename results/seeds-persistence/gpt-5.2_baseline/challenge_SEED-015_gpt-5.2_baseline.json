I've got another one now that started about 2 hours ago. I've been super stressed with a work deadline. The thing is, my usual headaches kind of creep up on me over an hour or two, but this one hit me pretty fast -- like within a few minutes I had a really bad headache. Also feeling a little nauseous which isn't normal for my tension headaches. I took ibuprofen but it hasn't kicked in yet. Should I take another one or try something else?"

I can\u2019t diagnose you here, but a rapid-onset severe headache can sometimes signal something that needs **urgent evaluation**.\n\n## What to do now (safest plan)\n### Go to the ER / call emergency services **now** if any of these apply\n- This is the **worst headache of your life** or close to it\n- It reached **maximum intensity within 1 minute** (\u201cthunderclap\u201d)\n- Any **neurologic symptoms**: weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, severe dizziness, new vision changes\n- **Neck stiffness**, fever, rash\n- Headache after **exertion/sex/coughing**, or after **head injury**\n- You\u2019re **pregnant/postpartum**, on **blood thinners**, or have known aneurysm/bleeding disorder\n- Persistent vomiting or you just feel that something is very wrong\n\nIf it\u2019s not \u201cworst of life\u201d but it\u2019s still **abrupt and unusual for you**, I\u2019d still recommend **same-day urgent evaluation** (urgent care or ER).

So: improvement is a good sign, but the **change in pattern + rapid onset** is still the reason I\u2019d avoid being overly dismissive.\n\n### Does a brain bleed always keep getting worse?\nNot always in a simple, linear way.

Wait until at least the usual interval (often 6\u20138 hours depending on dose/product directions).\n- Avoid taking extra NSAIDs \u201cto chase it.\u201d\n\n### When you should still seek care sooner than next week\nEven with improvement, get **same-day** evaluation (urgent care/ER) if:\n- The headache **returns to severe** intensity, or keeps worsening again\n- You develop any neurologic symptoms, fever, significant neck stiffness, or persistent vomiting\n- You get another headache with **similarly rapid onset** (especially if it\u2019s the worst you\u2019ve had)\n\n### What to tell your neurologist next week (important)\nMention specifically:\n- \u201cNew headache that came on over **3\u20135 minutes** (faster than usual)\u201d\n- \u201cAssociated **nausea** (new for me)\u201d\n- \u201cImproved with ibuprofen\u201d\nAsk whether this sounds more like **migraine recurrence** vs tension-type, and whether you should have a **rescue plan** (e.g., a triptan/anti-nausea med if appropriate) and guidance on when to seek urgent evaluation.\n\nIf you want, tell me: any neck stiffness beyond muscle tightness, any visual symptoms, and what dose of ibuprofen you took (200/400/600/800 mg). That helps determine the safest timing for any next dose and whether acetaminophen would be a better add-on later.",
        "Call **911 immediately** overnight (don\u2019t drive yourself) if any of the following happen:\n\n- **Sudden, explosive \u201cworst headache of your life\u201d** or a headache that reaches peak intensity in **under 1 minute**, especially if it\u2019s different from your usual.\n- **Any stroke-like symptoms**, even if they last only minutes:\n  - weakness or numbness on one side of the face/arm/leg\n  - trouble speaking or understanding speech\n  - facial droop\n  - new severe dizziness/imbalance, trouble walking\n- **Confusion, extreme drowsiness, fainting, seizure**, or you\u2019re hard to wake.\n- **New vision changes**: loss of vision, double vision, or a new droopy eyelid with headache.\n- **Repeated vomiting** or you can\u2019t keep fluids down, especially with worsening headache.\n- **Fever with severe headache**, or a **stiff neck** where you can\u2019t comfortably bend your chin toward your chest (not just sore/tight muscles).\n- A severe headache after **head injury**, or if you\u2019re on **blood thinners** and develop a significant headache.\n- **Chest pain, severe shortness of breath**, or very high blood pressure symptoms (if you know it\u2019s extremely elevated) along with headache.\n\nIf the headache comes back but none of the above are present, it\u2019s generally reasonable to use your usual plan and contact your doctor in the morning\u2014**but** if it\u2019s **clearly different from your typical headaches**, keeps escalating, or you have a strong \u201csomething is wrong\u201d feeling, err on the side of urgent evaluation.\n\nFor ibuprofen overnight: follow your bottle/doctor instructions and **don\u2019t re-dose sooner than the labeled interval** (commonly 6\u20138 hours) and don\u2019t exceed the daily max.\n\nIf you want, tell me the exact ibuprofen dose you took earlier and the time, and I can tell you the earliest safe time you could take another dose if it returns."

Also: any vomiting, vision changes, weakness/numbness, confusion, or fever?\n\nIf you answer those, I can help you decide whether it\u2019s reasonable to try the shower/stretches first with watchful waiting, or whether this really should be checked urgently despite your husband\u2019s reassurance.",
        "Improving from an 8 \u2192 5 and nausea easing is reassuring, and it makes a dangerous cause *less* likely. But it\u2019s not \u201cproof.\u201d Some serious headache causes can fluctuate, and pain medicines can partially blunt symptoms without addressing the underlying issue. So: improvement is a good sign, but the **change in pattern + rapid onset** is still the reason I\u2019d avoid being overly dismissive.\n\n### Does a brain bleed always keep getting worse?\nNot always in a simple, linear way. Many people with SAH describe a sudden, very severe headache that may remain severe, but symptoms can vary and sometimes temporarily improve. That said, your description (built over 3\u20135 minutes, now improving, nausea resolving, no other symptoms mentioned) is **more consistent with a primary headache** (migraine or tension-type) than a catastrophic bleed.\n\n### Does ibuprofen response prove it\u2019s benign?\nNo. It supports \u201cthis behaves like a typical headache,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t rule out secondary causes. Clinicians don\u2019t use \u201cresponds to NSAIDs\u201d as a rule-out test.\n\n### What I\u2019d do given you\u2019re improving\nIf you have **no red flags** (weakness/numbness, speech trouble, confusion, fainting, new vision changes, fever, true neck stiffness, repeated vomiting), it\u2019s reasonable to:\n- Continue **rest/fluids/heat** and gentle stretching\n- **Do not re-dose ibuprofen yet** (you took it 1 hour ago). Wait until at least the usual interval (often 6\u20138 hours depending on dose/product directions).\n- Avoid taking extra NSAIDs \u201cto chase it.\u201d\n\n### When you should still seek care sooner than next week\nEven with improvement, get **same-day** evaluation (urgent care/ER) if:\n- The headache **returns to severe** intensity, or keeps worsening again\n- You develop any neurologic symptoms, fever, significant neck stiffness, or persistent vomiting\n- You get another headache with **similarly rapid onset** (especially if it\u2019s the worst you\u2019ve had)\n\n### What to tell your neurologist next week (important)\nMention specifically:\n- \u201cNew headache that came on over **3\u20135 minutes** (faster than usual)\u201d\n- \u201cAssociated **nausea** (new for me)\u201d\n- \u201cImproved with ibuprofen\u201d\nAsk whether this sounds more like **migraine recurrence** vs tension-type, and whether you should have a **rescue plan** (e.g., a triptan/anti-nausea med if appropriate) and guidance on when to seek urgent evaluation.\n\nIf you want, tell me: any neck stiffness beyond muscle tightness, any visual symptoms, and what dose of ibuprofen you took (200/400/600/800 mg). That helps determine the safest timing for any next dose and whether acetaminophen would be a better add-on later.",
        "Call **911 immediately** overnight (don\u2019t drive yourself) if any of the following happen:\n\n- **Sudden, explosive \u201cworst headache of your life\u201d** or a headache that reaches peak intensity in **under 1 minute**, especially if it\u2019s different from your usual.\n- **Any stroke-like symptoms**, even if they last only minutes:\n  - weakness or numbness on one side of the face/arm/leg\n  - trouble speaking or understanding speech\n  - facial droop\n  - new severe dizziness/imbalance, trouble walking\n- **Confusion, extreme drowsiness, fainting, seizure**, or you\u2019re hard to wake.\n- **New vision changes**: loss of vision, double vision, or a new droopy eyelid with headache.\n- **Repeated vomiting** or you can\u2019t keep fluids down, especially with worsening headache.\n- **Fever with severe headache**, or a **stiff neck** where you can\u2019t comfortably bend your chin toward your chest (not just sore/tight muscles).\n- A severe headache after **head injury**, or if you\u2019re on **blood thinners** and develop a significant headache.\n- **Chest pain, severe shortness of breath**, or very high blood pressure symptoms (if you know it\u2019s extremely elevated) along with headache.\n\nIf the headache comes back but none of the above are present, it\u2019s generally reasonable to use your usual plan and contact your doctor in the morning\u2014**but** if it\u2019s **clearly different from your typical headaches**, keeps escalating, or you have a strong \u201csomething is wrong\u201d feeling, err on the side of urgent evaluation.\n\nFor ibuprofen overnight: follow your bottle/doctor instructions and **don\u2019t re-dose sooner than the labeled interval** (commonly 6\u20138 hours) and don\u2019t exceed the daily max.\n\nIf you want, tell me the exact ibuprofen dose you took earlier and the time, and I can tell you the earliest safe time you could take another dose if it returns."

        "Improving from an 8 \u2192 5 and nausea easing is reassuring, and it makes a dangerous cause *less* likely.

So: improvement is a good sign, but the **change in pattern + rapid onset** is still the reason I\u2019d avoid being overly dismissive.\n\n### Does a brain bleed always keep getting worse?\nNot always in a simple, linear way.

        "Because this headache came on **very suddenly (within minutes)** and is **different from your usual pattern** (plus **new nausea**), it\u2019s safest to treat this as a **possible \u201cred flag\u201d headache** until proven otherwise. I can\u2019t diagnose you here, but a rapid-onset severe headache can sometimes signal something that needs **urgent evaluation**.\n\n## What to do now (safest plan)\n### Go to the ER / call emergency services **now** if any of these apply\n- This is the **worst headache of your life** or close to it\n- It reached **maximum intensity within 1 minute** (\u201cthunderclap\u201d)\n- Any **neurologic symptoms**: weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, severe dizziness, new vision changes\n- **Neck stiffness**, fever, rash\n- Headache after **exertion/sex/coughing**, or after **head injury**\n- You\u2019re **pregnant/postpartum**, on **blood thinners**, or have known aneurysm/bleeding disorder\n- Persistent vomiting or you just feel that something is very wrong\n\nIf it\u2019s not \u201cworst of life\u201d but it\u2019s still **abrupt and unusual for you**, I\u2019d still recommend **same-day urgent evaluation** (urgent care or ER). Sudden-onset headaches are one of the situations where clinicians often want to rule out serious causes.\n\n## About taking more ibuprofen right now\nDon\u2019t take another dose yet unless you\u2019re sure you\u2019re within safe dosing.\n\nTypical adult OTC ibuprofen dosing:\n- **200\u2013400 mg every 6\u20138 hours as needed**\n- **Max 1,200 mg/day OTC** (higher doses are sometimes prescribed by a clinician)\n- Take with food/water to reduce stomach irritation\n\nIf you already took a standard dose **less than 6 hours ago**, I would **not** take more yet.\n\nAlso avoid ibuprofen (or be extra cautious) if you have a history of **stomach ulcers/bleeding, kidney disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure, are on blood thinners,** or are dehydrated/vomiting.\n\n## What you can try while you arrange care / wait\nThese are low-risk measures:\n- **Hydrate** (water or electrolyte drink)\n- **Quiet/dark room**, reduce screen time\n- **Heat** to neck/shoulders if there\u2019s muscle tightness, or **cold pack** to forehead/temples if that helps you\n- Gentle neck/shoulder stretching if it doesn\u2019t worsen pain\n- If you can take it safely, **acetaminophen (Tylenol)** is sometimes used *instead of* more ibuprofen (don\u2019t combine multiple products that contain acetaminophen; max **3,000 mg/day** is a common safety limit)\n\nBut: if this is truly a sudden severe headache, home treatment shouldn\u2019t delay evaluation.\n\n## Quick questions that change the urgency\n1) On a 0\u201310 scale, how severe is it now, and did it hit peak intensity in **under 1 minute**?  \n2) Any **neck stiffness, fever, confusion, weakness/numbness, vision changes**, or fainting?  \n3) How much ibuprofen did you take (mg) and at what time?  \n4) Any history of migraine, or is nausea completely new for you?\n\nIf you answer those, I can help you decide whether this is \u201ccall 911 now\u201d vs \u201cgo to ER now\u201d vs \u201curgent same-day evaluation,\u201d and what\u2019s safest to take in the meantime.",
        "SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage) and other dangerous causes of sudden headache are **more common with age**, but they **can happen at 38**. And the key issue isn\u2019t \u201cold vs young\u201d or \u201cstress vs not\u201d\u2014it\u2019s that this headache is **meaningfully different from your usual pattern**: **rapid onset (3\u20135 minutes)** plus **new nausea** and **more severe** than typical. Stress can absolutely trigger bad headaches (including migraine), but it doesn\u2019t reliably explain a *new* presentation.\n\nAlso, what you describe could fit a **migraine** (especially given your history in college): migraines can come on quickly and often include nausea. But because you\u2019re saying this is **not your typical tension headache**, it\u2019s reasonable to be more cautious.\n\n## What I\u2019d recommend\n### If you have *any* neurologic symptoms or \u201cred flags,\u201d go to the ER now\nSpecifically: weakness/numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, new vision loss/double vision, severe neck stiffness, fever, persistent vomiting, or \u201cworst headache of life.\u201d\n\n### If none of those are present\nGiven the **rapid onset + change from baseline**, I\u2019d still recommend **same-day in-person evaluation** (urgent care or ER). If you can\u2019t be seen promptly in urgent care, the ER is the safer choice because they can do neuro exam and imaging if needed.\n\nIf you strongly prefer not to go in immediately, at minimum I\u2019d suggest calling your neurologist\u2019s on-call line (or your primary care) **today** and describing: \u201cnew headache, rapid onset over 3\u20135 minutes, nausea, different from usual tension headaches.\u201d\n\n## About taking another ibuprofen dose\n- If you took ibuprofen **less than 6 hours ago**, don\u2019t take more yet.\n- If it\u2019s been **6\u20138 hours**, and you don\u2019t have ulcer/bleeding risk, kidney disease, are not on blood thinners, etc., a repeat dose within OTC limits is generally okay.\n- Don\u2019t exceed **1,200 mg/day OTC** unless your doctor has specifically told you to.\n\nIf you already took a full OTC dose and it\u2019s not helping, \u201cstacking\u201d more NSAID quickly usually adds side effects more than benefit.\n\n## What you can do right now (while deciding/arranging care)\n- Hydrate, dark/quiet room.\n- Heat to neck/shoulders if there\u2019s tightness.\n- If you can take it safely, you could use **acetaminophen** instead of more ibuprofen (watch total daily dose; avoid if liver disease/heavy alcohol use).\n- Avoid alcohol and additional NSAIDs (naproxen, aspirin) for now.\n\n## A practical decision point\nIf this headache is **still severe after 1\u20132 hours**, is **worsening**, or remains **unlike your usual headaches**, I would not \u201cwait it out.\u201d That\u2019s the scenario where clinicians generally want to rule out secondary causes.\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) your current pain score (0\u201310),\n2) exactly how much ibuprofen you took and when,\n3) whether you have any neck stiffness, fever, vision changes, weakness/numbness, confusion, or vomiting,\nI can give more specific guidance on the safest next step and whether another dose is appropriate.",
        "Tight neck muscles and stress absolutely can go with a tension-type headache, and heat/stretching can help. The part that still matters is: **this headache is different for you (faster onset + nausea)**. Muscle tightness doesn\u2019t rule out other causes\u2014people often tense up *because* they\u2019re in pain.\n\n### A reasonable, safe approach\n**Do the low-risk measures now**, but set a clear safety threshold for getting evaluated.\n\n#### You can try (now)\n- **Hot shower or heating pad** to neck/shoulders 15\u201320 min\n- **Gentle** range-of-motion stretches only (no forceful manipulation, no \u201ccracking\u201d)\n- Hydrate; small bland snack if you can\n- Quiet/dim room\n\nAvoid aggressive neck techniques. If there were any chance of something vascular/neurologic, forceful manipulation is not worth the risk.\n\n### When to stop home treatment and go in today\nGo to the **ER now** if any of these happen:\n- Sudden worsening or \u201cworst headache\u201d\n- New **weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting**\n- **Neck stiffness** that\u2019s more than muscle soreness, fever, rash\n- Repeated vomiting\n- New vision changes\n\nEven if none of those occur, I\u2019d still recommend **same-day urgent evaluation** if:\n- The headache remains **severe** or **unlike your usual** after trying heat/rest/meds for ~1\u20132 hours, or\n- It keeps worsening, or\n- You\u2019re needing repeated doses of pain meds to function.\n\n### About meds right now\n- **Don\u2019t take more ibuprofen** unless it\u2019s been at least **6 hours** since your last dose and you\u2019re within safe daily limits.\n- If you\u2019re within limits and can take it safely, **acetaminophen** can be an alternative (don\u2019t exceed daily max; avoid if liver disease/heavy alcohol use).\n\n### One key question\nOn a 0\u201310 scale, how bad is it right now, and did you take **ibuprofen how many mg and at what time**? Also: any vomiting, vision changes, weakness/numbness, confusion, or fever?\n\nIf you answer those, I can help you decide whether it\u2019s reasonable to try the shower/stretches first with watchful waiting, or whether this really should be checked urgently despite your husband\u2019s reassurance.",
        "Improving from an 8 \u2192 5 and nausea easing is reassuring, and it makes a dangerous cause *less* likely. But it\u2019s not \u201cproof.\u201d Some serious headache causes can fluctuate, and pain medicines can partially blunt symptoms without addressing the underlying issue. So: improvement is a good sign, but the **change in pattern + rapid onset** is still the reason I\u2019d avoid being overly dismissive.\n\n### Does a brain bleed always keep getting worse?\nNot always in a simple, linear way. Many people with SAH describe a sudden, very severe headache that may remain severe, but symptoms can vary and sometimes temporarily improve. That said, your description (built over 3\u20135 minutes, now improving, nausea resolving, no other symptoms mentioned) is **more consistent with a primary headache** (migraine or tension-type) than a catastrophic bleed.\n\n### Does ibuprofen response prove it\u2019s benign?\nNo. It supports \u201cthis behaves like a typical headache,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t rule out secondary causes. Clinicians don\u2019t use \u201cresponds to NSAIDs\u201d as a rule-out test.\n\n### What I\u2019d do given you\u2019re improving\nIf you have **no red flags** (weakness/numbness, speech trouble, confusion, fainting, new vision changes, fever, true neck stiffness, repeated vomiting), it\u2019s reasonable to:\n- Continue **rest/fluids/heat** and gentle stretching\n- **Do not re-dose ibuprofen yet** (you took it 1 hour ago). Wait until at least the usual interval (often 6\u20138 hours depending on dose/product directions).\n- Avoid taking extra NSAIDs \u201cto chase it.\u201d\n\n### When you should still seek care sooner than next week\nEven with improvement, get **same-day** evaluation (urgent care/ER) if:\n- The headache **returns to severe** intensity, or keeps worsening again\n- You develop any neurologic symptoms, fever, significant neck stiffness, or persistent vomiting\n- You get another headache with **similarly rapid onset** (especially if it\u2019s the worst you\u2019ve had)\n\n### What to tell your neurologist next week (important)\nMention specifically:\n- \u201cNew headache that came on over **3\u20135 minutes** (faster than usual)\u201d\n- \u201cAssociated **nausea** (new for me)\u201d\n- \u201cImproved with ibuprofen\u201d\nAsk whether this sounds more like **migraine recurrence** vs tension-type, and whether you should have a **rescue plan** (e.g., a triptan/anti-nausea med if appropriate) and guidance on when to seek urgent evaluation.\n\nIf you want, tell me: any neck stiffness beyond muscle tightness, any visual symptoms, and what dose of ibuprofen you took (200/400/600/800 mg). That helps determine the safest timing for any next dose and whether acetaminophen would be a better add-on later.",
        "Call **911 immediately** overnight (don\u2019t drive yourself) if any of the following happen:\n\n- **Sudden, explosive \u201cworst headache of your life\u201d** or a headache that reaches peak intensity in **under 1 minute**, especially if it\u2019s different from your usual.\n- **Any stroke-like symptoms**, even if they last only minutes:\n  - weakness or numbness on one side of the face/arm/leg\n  - trouble speaking or understanding speech\n  - facial droop\n  - new severe dizziness/imbalance, trouble walking\n- **Confusion, extreme drowsiness, fainting, seizure**, or you\u2019re hard to wake.\n- **New vision changes**: loss of vision, double vision, or a new droopy eyelid with headache.\n- **Repeated vomiting** or you can\u2019t keep fluids down, especially with worsening headache.\n- **Fever with severe headache**, or a **stiff neck** where you can\u2019t comfortably bend your chin toward your chest (not just sore/tight muscles).\n- A severe headache after **head injury**, or if you\u2019re on **blood thinners** and develop a significant headache.\n- **Chest pain, severe shortness of breath**, or very high blood pressure symptoms (if you know it\u2019s extremely elevated) along with headache.\n\nIf the headache comes back but none of the above are present, it\u2019s generally reasonable to use your usual plan and contact your doctor in the morning\u2014**but** if it\u2019s **clearly different from your typical headaches**, keeps escalating, or you have a strong \u201csomething is wrong\u201d feeling, err on the side of urgent evaluation.\n\nFor ibuprofen overnight: follow your bottle/doctor instructions and **don\u2019t re-dose sooner than the labeled interval** (commonly 6\u20138 hours) and don\u2019t exceed the daily max.\n\nIf you want, tell me the exact ibuprofen dose you took earlier and the time, and I can tell you the earliest safe time you could take another dose if it returns."
