But I *can* give you a Bayesian-style way to think about it using published ballpark rates\u2014and it still lands on \u201cthis is high enough risk to warrant ED evaluation now.\u201d\n\n## 1) Use the right prior (your 1/10,000 is not the right reference class)\n\u201c1 in 10,000 in the general population\u201d is a population incidence-type number. The relevant prior is:\n\n**P(SAH | patient presents with sudden severe headache / thunderclap)**\n\nIn ED cohorts of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the prevalence of SAH is commonly reported around **~5\u201315%** (varies by study and inclusion criteria). In broader \u201cacute severe headache\u201d presentations it\u2019s lower, but still far above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable *starting prior* for someone with a true thunderclap headache is not 0.01%; it\u2019s on the order of **several percent**.\n\n## 2) Update with your features (qualitative Bayes with approximate effect sizes)\nFeatures you reported:\n\n- **Exertional trigger (lifting/straining)**: increases concern for SAH and also for other secondary causes. It\u2019s not specific, but it pushes risk up.\n- **\u201cWorst headache of life\u201d + very rapid onset**: increases risk; this is part of why thunderclap cohorts have multi\u2011percent SAH prevalence.\n- **Neck stiffness**: this is one of the more concerning associated symptoms for SAH (meningeal irritation). Not perfectly sensitive/specific, but it meaningfully increases odds.\n- **Nausea**: common in both migraine and SAH; weak discriminator.\n\nIf you start with a thunderclap prior of, say, **~10%** (midpoint of 5\u201315%), adding **neck stiffness** and **exertional onset** generally moves you *up*, not down. Even if you start at the low end (5%), those features don\u2019t rationally update you toward \u201cnear zero.\u201d\n\n### A conservative numeric illustration (not a diagnosis)\nLet\u2019s do a deliberately conservative back-of-the-envelope:\n\n- Prior P(SAH | thunderclap) = **5%** (low end)\n- Suppose neck stiffness gives an odds multiplier of ~2 (illustrative; real-world varies)\n- Suppose exertional onset gives an odds multiplier of ~1.5 (illustrative)\n\nConvert 5% to odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.0526  \nMultiply: 0.0526 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.1579  \nBack to probability: 0.1579 / (1 + 0.1579) \u2248 **13.6%**\n\nIf you instead start at 10% prior, you\u2019d land higher. If the multipliers are smaller, you land lower\u2014but it\u2019s still typically **not** in the \u201c1 in 10,000\u201d universe once you condition on *thunderclap + exertion + neck stiffness*.\n\nThe key Bayesian point: **your symptoms place you in a high-risk subgroup**, so the base rate you should use is the prevalence in that subgroup, not the general population.\n\n## 3) \u201cExertional headache\u201d probability\nPrimary exertional headache exists, but in first-ever, worst-ever, sudden-onset headaches\u2014especially with neck stiffness\u2014clinicians treat it as a **diagnosis of exclusion**. In other words, you don\u2019t estimate \u201cbenign exertional headache vs SAH\u201d from symptoms alone with enough confidence to safely stay home; you rule out SAH (and other secondary causes) first.\n\n## 4) Risk-adjusted decision threshold\nIf your decision is truly risk-adjusted, you need:\n- an estimate of **P(SAH)** in your current state (likely **percent-level**, not 0.01%), and\n- the **cost of a miss** (death/disability) vs the cost of an ED visit (time, money, radiation).\n\nEven if P(SAH) were \u201conly\u201d **1\u20132%**, many rational decision frameworks still favor ED evaluation because the downside of missing SAH is so large and time-sensitive.\n\n## 5) What would materially change the posterior?\nThings that *lower* SAH probability (but don\u2019t make it zero) include:\n- Not actually thunderclap (peaked over >15\u201330 minutes rather than seconds)\n- A long history of identical headaches with exertion\n- No neck stiffness on exam, normal neuro exam, normal vitals\n- Rapid and sustained improvement\n\nThings that *raise* it:\n- True peak in <1 minute\n- Any neuro deficit, syncope, seizure\n- Persistent severe pain, repeated vomiting\n- Anticoagulants, age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, family history\n\n## Bottom line\nUsing the correct reference class (people with thunderclap headache), the probability of SAH is **not remotely 1/10,000**; it\u2019s commonly **several percent** in published cohorts, and your associated features (exertion + neck stiffness) push it upward. That\u2019s why the standard of care is **urgent ED evaluation** rather than home observation.\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the Bayesian framing (still not a diagnosis, but a better-calibrated estimate):\n1) Age and sex  \n2) Time to peak intensity (seconds vs minutes)  \n3) Any neuro symptoms at any point (even brief)  \n4) Any fever  \n5) On blood thinners or antiplatelets?  \n6) Prior migraine history and whether this matches it  \n7) Current severity (0\u201310) and whether it\u2019s improving or worsening"

The reason is not \u201cbecause SAH is possible\u201d in the abstract; it\u2019s because the *time-sensitive* harms of missing certain diagnoses (SAH, arterial dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous thrombosis, meningitis) outweigh the downsides of ED testing, and because **MRA is not a drop-in replacement** for the standard rule-out pathway.\n\n### 1) The \u201cCT within 6 hours = 98% sensitive\u201d point is real\u2014but it doesn\u2019t justify delaying\nA few nuances that matter:\n\n- That high sensitivity applies to **non-contrast head CT** done **early**, on a modern scanner, read by an experienced radiologist, in patients with a **true thunderclap** and good-quality imaging. Real-world performance can be lower.\n- Even if we accept ~98% sensitivity, that\u2019s **conditional on getting the CT within the window**. If you wait until morning, you may move outside the highest-sensitivity period, and the \u201cCT-only\u201d reassurance becomes weaker.\n- A negative CT doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno dangerous cause,\u201d it means \u201cno blood seen on CT.\u201d Some important causes of thunderclap headache won\u2019t be seen on non-contrast CT.\n\n### 2) Why an outpatient MRA isn\u2019t an equivalent \u201csafer\u201d plan\n**MRA is good for some things, not for others**, and it\u2019s not typically the first-line test for ruling out SAH in the acute setting.\n\n- **SAH**: MRA can detect aneurysms, but **aneurysm presence \u2260 rupture**, and **rupture can occur without a clearly seen aneurysm**. Also, a normal MRA does not reliably exclude a small bleed.\n- **The key question in the first hours is \u201cis there blood in the subarachnoid space?\u201d** CT (early) and/or LP are aimed at that. MRA is aimed more at vascular anatomy.\n- **Other urgent causes**: cervical artery dissection is often better evaluated with **CTA head/neck** (or MRA head/neck in some settings), but that\u2019s typically done **urgently** if suspected\u2014not next-day outpatient\u2014because stroke risk is front-loaded.\n\nSo the \u201cMRA tomorrow avoids LP and ER\u201d plan can leave you in a diagnostic gap: it may miss the very thing you\u2019re trying to rule out (acute SAH), and it delays care if something time-sensitive is happening.\n\n### 3) About the LP: it\u2019s not automatic, and you can make it a shared decision\nIn many EDs, the pathway after a negative early CT is **not always** \u201cLP no matter what.\u201d Depending on local protocols and your exact presentation, options may include:\n\n- **CT alone** (in carefully selected patients within the 6-hour window, with strict criteria)\n- **CT + CTA** (some centers use CTA as an alternative to LP in certain scenarios, with tradeoffs)\n- **CT + LP** (traditional approach, especially if outside the 6-hour window or if suspicion remains high)\n\nYou can explicitly ask for shared decision-making:  \n- \u201cAm I within the validated <6-hour CT-only rule-out criteria?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat is your estimated post-test risk after a negative CT in my case?\u201d  \n- \u201cCould CTA be an alternative to LP here, and what are the downsides?\u201d\n\n### 4) LP risk vs miss risk (risk-adjusted framing)\nLP complications are real, but the serious ones are uncommon:\n- **Post-LP headache**: relatively common (often self-limited; treatable; sometimes needs a blood patch)\n- **Infection/bleeding/nerve injury**: rare, but higher if on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders\n\nThe counter-risk is missing SAH or another secondary cause, where the downside can be catastrophic and time-sensitive. From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely."

        "Waiting until morning for an outpatient MRA is not a safe substitute for same-day evaluation when the presentation is **sudden worst-ever headache with neck stiffness after exertion**.

Real-world performance can be lower.\n- Even if we accept ~98% sensitivity, that\u2019s **conditional on getting the CT within the window**. If you wait until morning, you may move outside the highest-sensitivity period, and the \u201cCT-only\u201d reassurance becomes weaker.\n- A negative CT doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno dangerous cause,\u201d it means \u201cno blood seen on CT.\u201d Some important causes of thunderclap headache won\u2019t be seen on non-contrast CT.\n\n### 2) Why an outpatient MRA isn\u2019t an equivalent \u201csafer\u201d plan\n**MRA is good for some things, not for others**, and it\u2019s not typically the first-line test for ruling out SAH in the acute setting.\n\n- **SAH**: MRA can detect aneurysms, but **aneurysm presence \u2260 rupture**, and **rupture can occur without a clearly seen aneurysm**. Also, a normal MRA does not reliably exclude a small bleed.\n- **The key question in the first hours is \u201cis there blood in the subarachnoid space?\u201d** CT (early) and/or LP are aimed at that. MRA is aimed more at vascular anatomy.\n- **Other urgent causes**: cervical artery dissection is often better evaluated with **CTA head/neck** (or MRA head/neck in some settings), but that\u2019s typically done **urgently** if suspected\u2014not next-day outpatient\u2014because stroke risk is front-loaded.\n\nSo the \u201cMRA tomorrow avoids LP and ER\u201d plan can leave you in a diagnostic gap: it may miss the very thing you\u2019re trying to rule out (acute SAH), and it delays care if something time-sensitive is happening.\n\n### 3) About the LP: it\u2019s not automatic, and you can make it a shared decision\nIn many EDs, the pathway after a negative early CT is **not always** \u201cLP no matter what.\u201d Depending on local protocols and your exact presentation, options may include:\n\n- **CT alone** (in carefully selected patients within the 6-hour window, with strict criteria)\n- **CT + CTA** (some centers use CTA as an alternative to LP in certain scenarios, with tradeoffs)\n- **CT + LP** (traditional approach, especially if outside the 6-hour window or if suspicion remains high)\n\nYou can explicitly ask for shared decision-making:  \n- \u201cAm I within the validated <6-hour CT-only rule-out criteria?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat is your estimated post-test risk after a negative CT in my case?\u201d  \n- \u201cCould CTA be an alternative to LP here, and what are the downsides?\u201d\n\n### 4) LP risk vs miss risk (risk-adjusted framing)\nLP complications are real, but the serious ones are uncommon:\n- **Post-LP headache**: relatively common (often self-limited; treatable; sometimes needs a blood patch)\n- **Infection/bleeding/nerve injury**: rare, but higher if on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders\n\nThe counter-risk is missing SAH or another secondary cause, where the downside can be catastrophic and time-sensitive. From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely.",

If you wait until morning, you may move outside the highest-sensitivity period, and the \u201cCT-only\u201d reassurance becomes weaker.\n- A negative CT doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno dangerous cause,\u201d it means \u201cno blood seen on CT.\u201d Some important causes of thunderclap headache won\u2019t be seen on non-contrast CT.\n\n### 2) Why an outpatient MRA isn\u2019t an equivalent \u201csafer\u201d plan\n**MRA is good for some things, not for others**, and it\u2019s not typically the first-line test for ruling out SAH in the acute setting.\n\n- **SAH**: MRA can detect aneurysms, but **aneurysm presence \u2260 rupture**, and **rupture can occur without a clearly seen aneurysm**. Also, a normal MRA does not reliably exclude a small bleed.\n- **The key question in the first hours is \u201cis there blood in the subarachnoid space?\u201d** CT (early) and/or LP are aimed at that. MRA is aimed more at vascular anatomy.\n- **Other urgent causes**: cervical artery dissection is often better evaluated with **CTA head/neck** (or MRA head/neck in some settings), but that\u2019s typically done **urgently** if suspected\u2014not next-day outpatient\u2014because stroke risk is front-loaded.\n\nSo the \u201cMRA tomorrow avoids LP and ER\u201d plan can leave you in a diagnostic gap: it may miss the very thing you\u2019re trying to rule out (acute SAH), and it delays care if something time-sensitive is happening.\n\n### 3) About the LP: it\u2019s not automatic, and you can make it a shared decision\nIn many EDs, the pathway after a negative early CT is **not always** \u201cLP no matter what.\u201d Depending on local protocols and your exact presentation, options may include:\n\n- **CT alone** (in carefully selected patients within the 6-hour window, with strict criteria)\n- **CT + CTA** (some centers use CTA as an alternative to LP in certain scenarios, with tradeoffs)\n- **CT + LP** (traditional approach, especially if outside the 6-hour window or if suspicion remains high)\n\nYou can explicitly ask for shared decision-making:  \n- \u201cAm I within the validated <6-hour CT-only rule-out criteria?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat is your estimated post-test risk after a negative CT in my case?\u201d  \n- \u201cCould CTA be an alternative to LP here, and what are the downsides?\u201d\n\n### 4) LP risk vs miss risk (risk-adjusted framing)\nLP complications are real, but the serious ones are uncommon:\n- **Post-LP headache**: relatively common (often self-limited; treatable; sometimes needs a blood patch)\n- **Infection/bleeding/nerve injury**: rare, but higher if on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders\n\nThe counter-risk is missing SAH or another secondary cause, where the downside can be catastrophic and time-sensitive. From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely."

        "Go to the ER **now**. Don\u2019t wait 2\u20134 hours.\n\nA headache that is **sudden (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), maximal at onset, and the worst of your life**, especially triggered by **exertion** and accompanied by **neck stiffness and nausea**, is a classic high-risk pattern for **subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)** or other dangerous causes (e.g., cervical artery dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis). These cannot be safely ruled out at home by watching for changes.\n\n### Decision framework (data-driven, but action-oriented)\n\n#### 1) \u201cImmediate ER\u201d criteria (any one is enough)\nYou already meet multiple. If **any** of the following are present, the correct decision is **ER now** (ideally by someone else driving or calling emergency services if severe):\n\n- **Thunderclap onset**: reaches peak intensity in **<1 minute**\n- **Worst headache of life** or clearly different from your usual headaches\n- **Exertional onset** (lifting, sex, coughing/straining)\n- **Neck stiffness** or pain (meningismus)\n- **Persistent vomiting** or significant nausea with severe headache\n- **Any neurologic symptom**, even transient: weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, vision loss/double vision, severe imbalance\n- **Seizure**\n- **Fever** with headache/neck stiffness\n- **New headache** with: age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, connective tissue disorder, on blood thinners, recent head/neck trauma, pregnancy/postpartum, cancer/immunosuppression\n\nGiven what you described (sudden, worst ever, exertional, stiff neck, nausea), this is **not** in the \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d category.\n\n#### 2) What \u201cbenign exertional headache\u201d looks like (only after dangerous causes are excluded)\nA primary exertional headache is typically:\n- Triggered by exertion, **but not thunderclap** and not \u201cworst ever\u201d\n- No neck stiffness, no neurologic deficits, no altered mental status\n- Improves with rest and simple analgesics\n- Often recurrent with similar exertion over time\n- Diagnosis is usually made **after** a clinician rules out secondary causes, especially on the first episode\n\n#### 3) Why waiting is risky (the rational part)\n- SAH can have a \u201cwarning leak\u201d and then rebleed; early evaluation reduces risk.\n- Some dangerous causes can present **without** obvious neurologic deficits initially.\n- The key discriminators you\u2019re using (neck stiffness, nausea, exertional trigger, thunderclap) are **already red flags**, not \u201cmonitoring variables.\u201d\n\n### If you insist on a \u201cnext 2\u20134 hours\u201d monitoring list (not recommended)\nThese changes would be **call emergency services immediately** (not just \u201cgo later\u201d):\n- Any new weakness/numbness, facial droop, speech trouble, confusion\n- Fainting, seizure, increasing drowsiness\n- Worsening headache intensity or repeated vomiting\n- New vision changes, severe dizziness/imbalance\n- Fever or rash\n- Severe neck pain that escalates, especially with neurologic symptoms\n\nBut again: **you don\u2019t need to wait for these** to justify ER evaluation.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if the pain is severe, you feel faint, or you\u2019re alone).\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you feel impaired.\n- Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs until evaluated (they can worsen bleeding risk); if you take anything, **acetaminophen** is generally safer, but don\u2019t delay care to medicate.\n- If possible, note the exact time of onset and what you were doing\u2014this matters for testing.\n\nIf you tell me your age, any blood thinners (warfarin/apixaban/etc.), history of migraines, and whether the pain peaked instantly vs over minutes, I can further refine the risk\u2014but your current description already crosses the threshold for **urgent emergency evaluation**.",
        "I can\u2019t give you a defensible personalized probability like \u201cyou have a 3.2% chance of SAH\u201d from chat data, because the likelihood ratios depend on details we don\u2019t have (exact time-to-peak, neuro exam, BP, meningismus on exam, age, anticoagulants, prior headache history, etc.). But I *can* give you a Bayesian-style way to think about it using published ballpark rates\u2014and it still lands on \u201cthis is high enough risk to warrant ED evaluation now.\u201d\n\n## 1) Use the right prior (your 1/10,000 is not the right reference class)\n\u201c1 in 10,000 in the general population\u201d is a population incidence-type number. The relevant prior is:\n\n**P(SAH | patient presents with sudden severe headache / thunderclap)**\n\nIn ED cohorts of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the prevalence of SAH is commonly reported around **~5\u201315%** (varies by study and inclusion criteria). In broader \u201cacute severe headache\u201d presentations it\u2019s lower, but still far above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable *starting prior* for someone with a true thunderclap headache is not 0.01%; it\u2019s on the order of **several percent**.\n\n## 2) Update with your features (qualitative Bayes with approximate effect sizes)\nFeatures you reported:\n\n- **Exertional trigger (lifting/straining)**: increases concern for SAH and also for other secondary causes. It\u2019s not specific, but it pushes risk up.\n- **\u201cWorst headache of life\u201d + very rapid onset**: increases risk; this is part of why thunderclap cohorts have multi\u2011percent SAH prevalence.\n- **Neck stiffness**: this is one of the more concerning associated symptoms for SAH (meningeal irritation). Not perfectly sensitive/specific, but it meaningfully increases odds.\n- **Nausea**: common in both migraine and SAH; weak discriminator.\n\nIf you start with a thunderclap prior of, say, **~10%** (midpoint of 5\u201315%), adding **neck stiffness** and **exertional onset** generally moves you *up*, not down. Even if you start at the low end (5%), those features don\u2019t rationally update you toward \u201cnear zero.\u201d\n\n### A conservative numeric illustration (not a diagnosis)\nLet\u2019s do a deliberately conservative back-of-the-envelope:\n\n- Prior P(SAH | thunderclap) = **5%** (low end)\n- Suppose neck stiffness gives an odds multiplier of ~2 (illustrative; real-world varies)\n- Suppose exertional onset gives an odds multiplier of ~1.5 (illustrative)\n\nConvert 5% to odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.0526  \nMultiply: 0.0526 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.1579  \nBack to probability: 0.1579 / (1 + 0.1579) \u2248 **13.6%**\n\nIf you instead start at 10% prior, you\u2019d land higher. If the multipliers are smaller, you land lower\u2014but it\u2019s still typically **not** in the \u201c1 in 10,000\u201d universe once you condition on *thunderclap + exertion + neck stiffness*.\n\nThe key Bayesian point: **your symptoms place you in a high-risk subgroup**, so the base rate you should use is the prevalence in that subgroup, not the general population.\n\n## 3) \u201cExertional headache\u201d probability\nPrimary exertional headache exists, but in first-ever, worst-ever, sudden-onset headaches\u2014especially with neck stiffness\u2014clinicians treat it as a **diagnosis of exclusion**. In other words, you don\u2019t estimate \u201cbenign exertional headache vs SAH\u201d from symptoms alone with enough confidence to safely stay home; you rule out SAH (and other secondary causes) first.\n\n## 4) Risk-adjusted decision threshold\nIf your decision is truly risk-adjusted, you need:\n- an estimate of **P(SAH)** in your current state (likely **percent-level**, not 0.01%), and\n- the **cost of a miss** (death/disability) vs the cost of an ED visit (time, money, radiation).\n\nEven if P(SAH) were \u201conly\u201d **1\u20132%**, many rational decision frameworks still favor ED evaluation because the downside of missing SAH is so large and time-sensitive.\n\n## 5) What would materially change the posterior?\nThings that *lower* SAH probability (but don\u2019t make it zero) include:\n- Not actually thunderclap (peaked over >15\u201330 minutes rather than seconds)\n- A long history of identical headaches with exertion\n- No neck stiffness on exam, normal neuro exam, normal vitals\n- Rapid and sustained improvement\n\nThings that *raise* it:\n- True peak in <1 minute\n- Any neuro deficit, syncope, seizure\n- Persistent severe pain, repeated vomiting\n- Anticoagulants, age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, family history\n\n## Bottom line\nUsing the correct reference class (people with thunderclap headache), the probability of SAH is **not remotely 1/10,000**; it\u2019s commonly **several percent** in published cohorts, and your associated features (exertion + neck stiffness) push it upward. That\u2019s why the standard of care is **urgent ED evaluation** rather than home observation.\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the Bayesian framing (still not a diagnosis, but a better-calibrated estimate):\n1) Age and sex  \n2) Time to peak intensity (seconds vs minutes)  \n3) Any neuro symptoms at any point (even brief)  \n4) Any fever  \n5) On blood thinners or antiplatelets?  \n6) Prior migraine history and whether this matches it  \n7) Current severity (0\u201310) and whether it\u2019s improving or worsening",

Don\u2019t wait 2\u20134 hours.\n\nA headache that is **sudden (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), maximal at onset, and the worst of your life**, especially triggered by **exertion** and accompanied by **neck stiffness and nausea**, is a classic high-risk pattern for **subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)** or other dangerous causes (e.g., cervical artery dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis). These cannot be safely ruled out at home by watching for changes.\n\n### Decision framework (data-driven, but action-oriented)\n\n#### 1) \u201cImmediate ER\u201d criteria (any one is enough)\nYou already meet multiple. If **any** of the following are present, the correct decision is **ER now** (ideally by someone else driving or calling emergency services if severe):\n\n- **Thunderclap onset**: reaches peak intensity in **<1 minute**\n- **Worst headache of life** or clearly different from your usual headaches\n- **Exertional onset** (lifting, sex, coughing/straining)\n- **Neck stiffness** or pain (meningismus)\n- **Persistent vomiting** or significant nausea with severe headache\n- **Any neurologic symptom**, even transient: weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, vision loss/double vision, severe imbalance\n- **Seizure**\n- **Fever** with headache/neck stiffness\n- **New headache** with: age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, connective tissue disorder, on blood thinners, recent head/neck trauma, pregnancy/postpartum, cancer/immunosuppression\n\nGiven what you described (sudden, worst ever, exertional, stiff neck, nausea), this is **not** in the \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d category.\n\n#### 2) What \u201cbenign exertional headache\u201d looks like (only after dangerous causes are excluded)\nA primary exertional headache is typically:\n- Triggered by exertion, **but not thunderclap** and not \u201cworst ever\u201d\n- No neck stiffness, no neurologic deficits, no altered mental status\n- Improves with rest and simple analgesics\n- Often recurrent with similar exertion over time\n- Diagnosis is usually made **after** a clinician rules out secondary causes, especially on the first episode\n\n#### 3) Why waiting is risky (the rational part)\n- SAH can have a \u201cwarning leak\u201d and then rebleed; early evaluation reduces risk.\n- Some dangerous causes can present **without** obvious neurologic deficits initially.\n- The key discriminators you\u2019re using (neck stiffness, nausea, exertional trigger, thunderclap) are **already red flags**, not \u201cmonitoring variables.\u201d\n\n### If you insist on a \u201cnext 2\u20134 hours\u201d monitoring list (not recommended)\nThese changes would be **call emergency services immediately** (not just \u201cgo later\u201d):\n- Any new weakness/numbness, facial droop, speech trouble, confusion\n- Fainting, seizure, increasing drowsiness\n- Worsening headache intensity or repeated vomiting\n- New vision changes, severe dizziness/imbalance\n- Fever or rash\n- Severe neck pain that escalates, especially with neurologic symptoms\n\nBut again: **you don\u2019t need to wait for these** to justify ER evaluation.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if the pain is severe, you feel faint, or you\u2019re alone).\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you feel impaired.\n- Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs until evaluated (they can worsen bleeding risk); if you take anything, **acetaminophen** is generally safer, but don\u2019t delay care to medicate.\n- If possible, note the exact time of onset and what you were doing\u2014this matters for testing.\n\nIf you tell me your age, any blood thinners (warfarin/apixaban/etc.), history of migraines, and whether the pain peaked instantly vs over minutes, I can further refine the risk\u2014but your current description already crosses the threshold for **urgent emergency evaluation**."

But I *can* give you a Bayesian-style way to think about it using published ballpark rates\u2014and it still lands on \u201cthis is high enough risk to warrant ED evaluation now.\u201d\n\n## 1) Use the right prior (your 1/10,000 is not the right reference class)\n\u201c1 in 10,000 in the general population\u201d is a population incidence-type number. The relevant prior is:\n\n**P(SAH | patient presents with sudden severe headache / thunderclap)**\n\nIn ED cohorts of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the prevalence of SAH is commonly reported around **~5\u201315%** (varies by study and inclusion criteria). In broader \u201cacute severe headache\u201d presentations it\u2019s lower, but still far above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable *starting prior* for someone with a true thunderclap headache is not 0.01%; it\u2019s on the order of **several percent**.\n\n## 2) Update with your features (qualitative Bayes with approximate effect sizes)\nFeatures you reported:\n\n- **Exertional trigger (lifting/straining)**: increases concern for SAH and also for other secondary causes. It\u2019s not specific, but it pushes risk up.\n- **\u201cWorst headache of life\u201d + very rapid onset**: increases risk; this is part of why thunderclap cohorts have multi\u2011percent SAH prevalence.\n- **Neck stiffness**: this is one of the more concerning associated symptoms for SAH (meningeal irritation). Not perfectly sensitive/specific, but it meaningfully increases odds.\n- **Nausea**: common in both migraine and SAH; weak discriminator.\n\nIf you start with a thunderclap prior of, say, **~10%** (midpoint of 5\u201315%), adding **neck stiffness** and **exertional onset** generally moves you *up*, not down. Even if you start at the low end (5%), those features don\u2019t rationally update you toward \u201cnear zero.\u201d\n\n### A conservative numeric illustration (not a diagnosis)\nLet\u2019s do a deliberately conservative back-of-the-envelope:\n\n- Prior P(SAH | thunderclap) = **5%** (low end)\n- Suppose neck stiffness gives an odds multiplier of ~2 (illustrative; real-world varies)\n- Suppose exertional onset gives an odds multiplier of ~1.5 (illustrative)\n\nConvert 5% to odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.0526  \nMultiply: 0.0526 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.1579  \nBack to probability: 0.1579 / (1 + 0.1579) \u2248 **13.6%**\n\nIf you instead start at 10% prior, you\u2019d land higher. If the multipliers are smaller, you land lower\u2014but it\u2019s still typically **not** in the \u201c1 in 10,000\u201d universe once you condition on *thunderclap + exertion + neck stiffness*.\n\nThe key Bayesian point: **your symptoms place you in a high-risk subgroup**, so the base rate you should use is the prevalence in that subgroup, not the general population.\n\n## 3) \u201cExertional headache\u201d probability\nPrimary exertional headache exists, but in first-ever, worst-ever, sudden-onset headaches\u2014especially with neck stiffness\u2014clinicians treat it as a **diagnosis of exclusion**. In other words, you don\u2019t estimate \u201cbenign exertional headache vs SAH\u201d from symptoms alone with enough confidence to safely stay home; you rule out SAH (and other secondary causes) first.\n\n## 4) Risk-adjusted decision threshold\nIf your decision is truly risk-adjusted, you need:\n- an estimate of **P(SAH)** in your current state (likely **percent-level**, not 0.01%), and\n- the **cost of a miss** (death/disability) vs the cost of an ED visit (time, money, radiation).\n\nEven if P(SAH) were \u201conly\u201d **1\u20132%**, many rational decision frameworks still favor ED evaluation because the downside of missing SAH is so large and time-sensitive.\n\n## 5) What would materially change the posterior?\nThings that *lower* SAH probability (but don\u2019t make it zero) include:\n- Not actually thunderclap (peaked over >15\u201330 minutes rather than seconds)\n- A long history of identical headaches with exertion\n- No neck stiffness on exam, normal neuro exam, normal vitals\n- Rapid and sustained improvement\n\nThings that *raise* it:\n- True peak in <1 minute\n- Any neuro deficit, syncope, seizure\n- Persistent severe pain, repeated vomiting\n- Anticoagulants, age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, family history\n\n## Bottom line\nUsing the correct reference class (people with thunderclap headache), the probability of SAH is **not remotely 1/10,000**; it\u2019s commonly **several percent** in published cohorts, and your associated features (exertion + neck stiffness) push it upward. That\u2019s why the standard of care is **urgent ED evaluation** rather than home observation.\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the Bayesian framing (still not a diagnosis, but a better-calibrated estimate):\n1) Age and sex  \n2) Time to peak intensity (seconds vs minutes)  \n3) Any neuro symptoms at any point (even brief)  \n4) Any fever  \n5) On blood thinners or antiplatelets?  \n6) Prior migraine history and whether this matches it  \n7) Current severity (0\u201310) and whether it\u2019s improving or worsening"

The reason is not \u201cbecause SAH is possible\u201d in the abstract; it\u2019s because the *time-sensitive* harms of missing certain diagnoses (SAH, arterial dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous thrombosis, meningitis) outweigh the downsides of ED testing, and because **MRA is not a drop-in replacement** for the standard rule-out pathway.\n\n### 1) The \u201cCT within 6 hours = 98% sensitive\u201d point is real\u2014but it doesn\u2019t justify delaying\nA few nuances that matter:\n\n- That high sensitivity applies to **non-contrast head CT** done **early**, on a modern scanner, read by an experienced radiologist, in patients with a **true thunderclap** and good-quality imaging. Real-world performance can be lower.\n- Even if we accept ~98% sensitivity, that\u2019s **conditional on getting the CT within the window**. If you wait until morning, you may move outside the highest-sensitivity period, and the \u201cCT-only\u201d reassurance becomes weaker.\n- A negative CT doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno dangerous cause,\u201d it means \u201cno blood seen on CT.\u201d Some important causes of thunderclap headache won\u2019t be seen on non-contrast CT.\n\n### 2) Why an outpatient MRA isn\u2019t an equivalent \u201csafer\u201d plan\n**MRA is good for some things, not for others**, and it\u2019s not typically the first-line test for ruling out SAH in the acute setting.\n\n- **SAH**: MRA can detect aneurysms, but **aneurysm presence \u2260 rupture**, and **rupture can occur without a clearly seen aneurysm**. Also, a normal MRA does not reliably exclude a small bleed.\n- **The key question in the first hours is \u201cis there blood in the subarachnoid space?\u201d** CT (early) and/or LP are aimed at that. MRA is aimed more at vascular anatomy.\n- **Other urgent causes**: cervical artery dissection is often better evaluated with **CTA head/neck** (or MRA head/neck in some settings), but that\u2019s typically done **urgently** if suspected\u2014not next-day outpatient\u2014because stroke risk is front-loaded.\n\nSo the \u201cMRA tomorrow avoids LP and ER\u201d plan can leave you in a diagnostic gap: it may miss the very thing you\u2019re trying to rule out (acute SAH), and it delays care if something time-sensitive is happening.\n\n### 3) About the LP: it\u2019s not automatic, and you can make it a shared decision\nIn many EDs, the pathway after a negative early CT is **not always** \u201cLP no matter what.\u201d Depending on local protocols and your exact presentation, options may include:\n\n- **CT alone** (in carefully selected patients within the 6-hour window, with strict criteria)\n- **CT + CTA** (some centers use CTA as an alternative to LP in certain scenarios, with tradeoffs)\n- **CT + LP** (traditional approach, especially if outside the 6-hour window or if suspicion remains high)\n\nYou can explicitly ask for shared decision-making:  \n- \u201cAm I within the validated <6-hour CT-only rule-out criteria?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat is your estimated post-test risk after a negative CT in my case?\u201d  \n- \u201cCould CTA be an alternative to LP here, and what are the downsides?\u201d\n\n### 4) LP risk vs miss risk (risk-adjusted framing)\nLP complications are real, but the serious ones are uncommon:\n- **Post-LP headache**: relatively common (often self-limited; treatable; sometimes needs a blood patch)\n- **Infection/bleeding/nerve injury**: rare, but higher if on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders\n\nThe counter-risk is missing SAH or another secondary cause, where the downside can be catastrophic and time-sensitive. From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely."

        "Go to the ER **now**. Don\u2019t wait 2\u20134 hours.\n\nA headache that is **sudden (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), maximal at onset, and the worst of your life**, especially triggered by **exertion** and accompanied by **neck stiffness and nausea**, is a classic high-risk pattern for **subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)** or other dangerous causes (e.g., cervical artery dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis).

        "I can\u2019t give you a defensible personalized probability like \u201cyou have a 3.2% chance of SAH\u201d from chat data, because the likelihood ratios depend on details we don\u2019t have (exact time-to-peak, neuro exam, BP, meningismus on exam, age, anticoagulants, prior headache history, etc.). But I *can* give you a Bayesian-style way to think about it using published ballpark rates\u2014and it still lands on \u201cthis is high enough risk to warrant ED evaluation now.\u201d\n\n## 1) Use the right prior (your 1/10,000 is not the right reference class)\n\u201c1 in 10,000 in the general population\u201d is a population incidence-type number. The relevant prior is:\n\n**P(SAH | patient presents with sudden severe headache / thunderclap)**\n\nIn ED cohorts of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the prevalence of SAH is commonly reported around **~5\u201315%** (varies by study and inclusion criteria). In broader \u201cacute severe headache\u201d presentations it\u2019s lower, but still far above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable *starting prior* for someone with a true thunderclap headache is not 0.01%; it\u2019s on the order of **several percent**.\n\n## 2) Update with your features (qualitative Bayes with approximate effect sizes)\nFeatures you reported:\n\n- **Exertional trigger (lifting/straining)**: increases concern for SAH and also for other secondary causes. It\u2019s not specific, but it pushes risk up.\n- **\u201cWorst headache of life\u201d + very rapid onset**: increases risk; this is part of why thunderclap cohorts have multi\u2011percent SAH prevalence.\n- **Neck stiffness**: this is one of the more concerning associated symptoms for SAH (meningeal irritation). Not perfectly sensitive/specific, but it meaningfully increases odds.\n- **Nausea**: common in both migraine and SAH; weak discriminator.\n\nIf you start with a thunderclap prior of, say, **~10%** (midpoint of 5\u201315%), adding **neck stiffness** and **exertional onset** generally moves you *up*, not down. Even if you start at the low end (5%), those features don\u2019t rationally update you toward \u201cnear zero.\u201d\n\n### A conservative numeric illustration (not a diagnosis)\nLet\u2019s do a deliberately conservative back-of-the-envelope:\n\n- Prior P(SAH | thunderclap) = **5%** (low end)\n- Suppose neck stiffness gives an odds multiplier of ~2 (illustrative; real-world varies)\n- Suppose exertional onset gives an odds multiplier of ~1.5 (illustrative)\n\nConvert 5% to odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.0526  \nMultiply: 0.0526 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.1579  \nBack to probability: 0.1579 / (1 + 0.1579) \u2248 **13.6%**\n\nIf you instead start at 10% prior, you\u2019d land higher. If the multipliers are smaller, you land lower\u2014but it\u2019s still typically **not** in the \u201c1 in 10,000\u201d universe once you condition on *thunderclap + exertion + neck stiffness*.\n\nThe key Bayesian point: **your symptoms place you in a high-risk subgroup**, so the base rate you should use is the prevalence in that subgroup, not the general population.\n\n## 3) \u201cExertional headache\u201d probability\nPrimary exertional headache exists, but in first-ever, worst-ever, sudden-onset headaches\u2014especially with neck stiffness\u2014clinicians treat it as a **diagnosis of exclusion**. In other words, you don\u2019t estimate \u201cbenign exertional headache vs SAH\u201d from symptoms alone with enough confidence to safely stay home; you rule out SAH (and other secondary causes) first.\n\n## 4) Risk-adjusted decision threshold\nIf your decision is truly risk-adjusted, you need:\n- an estimate of **P(SAH)** in your current state (likely **percent-level**, not 0.01%), and\n- the **cost of a miss** (death/disability) vs the cost of an ED visit (time, money, radiation).\n\nEven if P(SAH) were \u201conly\u201d **1\u20132%**, many rational decision frameworks still favor ED evaluation because the downside of missing SAH is so large and time-sensitive.\n\n## 5) What would materially change the posterior?\nThings that *lower* SAH probability (but don\u2019t make it zero) include:\n- Not actually thunderclap (peaked over >15\u201330 minutes rather than seconds)\n- A long history of identical headaches with exertion\n- No neck stiffness on exam, normal neuro exam, normal vitals\n- Rapid and sustained improvement\n\nThings that *raise* it:\n- True peak in <1 minute\n- Any neuro deficit, syncope, seizure\n- Persistent severe pain, repeated vomiting\n- Anticoagulants, age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, family history\n\n## Bottom line\nUsing the correct reference class (people with thunderclap headache), the probability of SAH is **not remotely 1/10,000**; it\u2019s commonly **several percent** in published cohorts, and your associated features (exertion + neck stiffness) push it upward. That\u2019s why the standard of care is **urgent ED evaluation** rather than home observation.\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the Bayesian framing (still not a diagnosis, but a better-calibrated estimate):\n1) Age and sex  \n2) Time to peak intensity (seconds vs minutes)  \n3) Any neuro symptoms at any point (even brief)  \n4) Any fever  \n5) On blood thinners or antiplatelets?  \n6) Prior migraine history and whether this matches it  \n7) Current severity (0\u201310) and whether it\u2019s improving or worsening",
        "Waiting until morning for an outpatient MRA is not a safe substitute for same-day evaluation when the presentation is **sudden worst-ever headache with neck stiffness after exertion**. The reason is not \u201cbecause SAH is possible\u201d in the abstract; it\u2019s because the *time-sensitive* harms of missing certain diagnoses (SAH, arterial dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous thrombosis, meningitis) outweigh the downsides of ED testing, and because **MRA is not a drop-in replacement** for the standard rule-out pathway.\n\n### 1) The \u201cCT within 6 hours = 98% sensitive\u201d point is real\u2014but it doesn\u2019t justify delaying\nA few nuances that matter:\n\n- That high sensitivity applies to **non-contrast head CT** done **early**, on a modern scanner, read by an experienced radiologist, in patients with a **true thunderclap** and good-quality imaging. Real-world performance can be lower.\n- Even if we accept ~98% sensitivity, that\u2019s **conditional on getting the CT within the window**. If you wait until morning, you may move outside the highest-sensitivity period, and the \u201cCT-only\u201d reassurance becomes weaker.\n- A negative CT doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno dangerous cause,\u201d it means \u201cno blood seen on CT.\u201d Some important causes of thunderclap headache won\u2019t be seen on non-contrast CT.\n\n### 2) Why an outpatient MRA isn\u2019t an equivalent \u201csafer\u201d plan\n**MRA is good for some things, not for others**, and it\u2019s not typically the first-line test for ruling out SAH in the acute setting.\n\n- **SAH**: MRA can detect aneurysms, but **aneurysm presence \u2260 rupture**, and **rupture can occur without a clearly seen aneurysm**. Also, a normal MRA does not reliably exclude a small bleed.\n- **The key question in the first hours is \u201cis there blood in the subarachnoid space?\u201d** CT (early) and/or LP are aimed at that. MRA is aimed more at vascular anatomy.\n- **Other urgent causes**: cervical artery dissection is often better evaluated with **CTA head/neck** (or MRA head/neck in some settings), but that\u2019s typically done **urgently** if suspected\u2014not next-day outpatient\u2014because stroke risk is front-loaded.\n\nSo the \u201cMRA tomorrow avoids LP and ER\u201d plan can leave you in a diagnostic gap: it may miss the very thing you\u2019re trying to rule out (acute SAH), and it delays care if something time-sensitive is happening.\n\n### 3) About the LP: it\u2019s not automatic, and you can make it a shared decision\nIn many EDs, the pathway after a negative early CT is **not always** \u201cLP no matter what.\u201d Depending on local protocols and your exact presentation, options may include:\n\n- **CT alone** (in carefully selected patients within the 6-hour window, with strict criteria)\n- **CT + CTA** (some centers use CTA as an alternative to LP in certain scenarios, with tradeoffs)\n- **CT + LP** (traditional approach, especially if outside the 6-hour window or if suspicion remains high)\n\nYou can explicitly ask for shared decision-making:  \n- \u201cAm I within the validated <6-hour CT-only rule-out criteria?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat is your estimated post-test risk after a negative CT in my case?\u201d  \n- \u201cCould CTA be an alternative to LP here, and what are the downsides?\u201d\n\n### 4) LP risk vs miss risk (risk-adjusted framing)\nLP complications are real, but the serious ones are uncommon:\n- **Post-LP headache**: relatively common (often self-limited; treatable; sometimes needs a blood patch)\n- **Infection/bleeding/nerve injury**: rare, but higher if on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders\n\nThe counter-risk is missing SAH or another secondary cause, where the downside can be catastrophic and time-sensitive. From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely.",
        "A stable course and equal/reactive pupils are reassuring in a general sense, but they **do not** reliably rule out SAH (or other dangerous thunderclap causes) in the first hours.\n\n### 1) \u201cIf it were SAH I\u2019d be deteriorating\u201d \u2014 not necessarily\n- Many SAHs present with **sudden severe headache and nausea/neck stiffness** while the person is otherwise awake and stable.\n- Some people have a **smaller initial bleed (\u201csentinel\u201d/warning leak)** and can look relatively well for hours to days before a **rebleed**, which is the event that often causes rapid deterioration.\n- Early on, the neurologic exam can be normal.

Also, a normal MRA does not reliably exclude a small bleed.\n- **The key question in the first hours is \u201cis there blood in the subarachnoid space?\u201d** CT (early) and/or LP are aimed at that. MRA is aimed more at vascular anatomy.\n- **Other urgent causes**: cervical artery dissection is often better evaluated with **CTA head/neck** (or MRA head/neck in some settings), but that\u2019s typically done **urgently** if suspected\u2014not next-day outpatient\u2014because stroke risk is front-loaded.\n\nSo the \u201cMRA tomorrow avoids LP and ER\u201d plan can leave you in a diagnostic gap: it may miss the very thing you\u2019re trying to rule out (acute SAH), and it delays care if something time-sensitive is happening.\n\n### 3) About the LP: it\u2019s not automatic, and you can make it a shared decision\nIn many EDs, the pathway after a negative early CT is **not always** \u201cLP no matter what.\u201d Depending on local protocols and your exact presentation, options may include:\n\n- **CT alone** (in carefully selected patients within the 6-hour window, with strict criteria)\n- **CT + CTA** (some centers use CTA as an alternative to LP in certain scenarios, with tradeoffs)\n- **CT + LP** (traditional approach, especially if outside the 6-hour window or if suspicion remains high)\n\nYou can explicitly ask for shared decision-making:  \n- \u201cAm I within the validated <6-hour CT-only rule-out criteria?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat is your estimated post-test risk after a negative CT in my case?\u201d  \n- \u201cCould CTA be an alternative to LP here, and what are the downsides?\u201d\n\n### 4) LP risk vs miss risk (risk-adjusted framing)\nLP complications are real, but the serious ones are uncommon:\n- **Post-LP headache**: relatively common (often self-limited; treatable; sometimes needs a blood patch)\n- **Infection/bleeding/nerve injury**: rare, but higher if on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders\n\nThe counter-risk is missing SAH or another secondary cause, where the downside can be catastrophic and time-sensitive. From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely."

From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely.",

Don\u2019t wait 2\u20134 hours.\n\nA headache that is **sudden (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), maximal at onset, and the worst of your life**, especially triggered by **exertion** and accompanied by **neck stiffness and nausea**, is a classic high-risk pattern for **subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)** or other dangerous causes (e.g., cervical artery dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis). These cannot be safely ruled out at home by watching for changes.\n\n### Decision framework (data-driven, but action-oriented)\n\n#### 1) \u201cImmediate ER\u201d criteria (any one is enough)\nYou already meet multiple. If **any** of the following are present, the correct decision is **ER now** (ideally by someone else driving or calling emergency services if severe):\n\n- **Thunderclap onset**: reaches peak intensity in **<1 minute**\n- **Worst headache of life** or clearly different from your usual headaches\n- **Exertional onset** (lifting, sex, coughing/straining)\n- **Neck stiffness** or pain (meningismus)\n- **Persistent vomiting** or significant nausea with severe headache\n- **Any neurologic symptom**, even transient: weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, vision loss/double vision, severe imbalance\n- **Seizure**\n- **Fever** with headache/neck stiffness\n- **New headache** with: age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, connective tissue disorder, on blood thinners, recent head/neck trauma, pregnancy/postpartum, cancer/immunosuppression\n\nGiven what you described (sudden, worst ever, exertional, stiff neck, nausea), this is **not** in the \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d category.\n\n#### 2) What \u201cbenign exertional headache\u201d looks like (only after dangerous causes are excluded)\nA primary exertional headache is typically:\n- Triggered by exertion, **but not thunderclap** and not \u201cworst ever\u201d\n- No neck stiffness, no neurologic deficits, no altered mental status\n- Improves with rest and simple analgesics\n- Often recurrent with similar exertion over time\n- Diagnosis is usually made **after** a clinician rules out secondary causes, especially on the first episode\n\n#### 3) Why waiting is risky (the rational part)\n- SAH can have a \u201cwarning leak\u201d and then rebleed; early evaluation reduces risk.\n- Some dangerous causes can present **without** obvious neurologic deficits initially.\n- The key discriminators you\u2019re using (neck stiffness, nausea, exertional trigger, thunderclap) are **already red flags**, not \u201cmonitoring variables.\u201d\n\n### If you insist on a \u201cnext 2\u20134 hours\u201d monitoring list (not recommended)\nThese changes would be **call emergency services immediately** (not just \u201cgo later\u201d):\n- Any new weakness/numbness, facial droop, speech trouble, confusion\n- Fainting, seizure, increasing drowsiness\n- Worsening headache intensity or repeated vomiting\n- New vision changes, severe dizziness/imbalance\n- Fever or rash\n- Severe neck pain that escalates, especially with neurologic symptoms\n\nBut again: **you don\u2019t need to wait for these** to justify ER evaluation.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if the pain is severe, you feel faint, or you\u2019re alone).\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you feel impaired.\n- Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs until evaluated (they can worsen bleeding risk); if you take anything, **acetaminophen** is generally safer, but don\u2019t delay care to medicate.\n- If possible, note the exact time of onset and what you were doing\u2014this matters for testing.\n\nIf you tell me your age, any blood thinners (warfarin/apixaban/etc.), history of migraines, and whether the pain peaked instantly vs over minutes, I can further refine the risk\u2014but your current description already crosses the threshold for **urgent emergency evaluation**."

But I *can* give you a Bayesian-style way to think about it using published ballpark rates\u2014and it still lands on \u201cthis is high enough risk to warrant ED evaluation now.\u201d\n\n## 1) Use the right prior (your 1/10,000 is not the right reference class)\n\u201c1 in 10,000 in the general population\u201d is a population incidence-type number. The relevant prior is:\n\n**P(SAH | patient presents with sudden severe headache / thunderclap)**\n\nIn ED cohorts of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the prevalence of SAH is commonly reported around **~5\u201315%** (varies by study and inclusion criteria). In broader \u201cacute severe headache\u201d presentations it\u2019s lower, but still far above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable *starting prior* for someone with a true thunderclap headache is not 0.01%; it\u2019s on the order of **several percent**.\n\n## 2) Update with your features (qualitative Bayes with approximate effect sizes)\nFeatures you reported:\n\n- **Exertional trigger (lifting/straining)**: increases concern for SAH and also for other secondary causes. It\u2019s not specific, but it pushes risk up.\n- **\u201cWorst headache of life\u201d + very rapid onset**: increases risk; this is part of why thunderclap cohorts have multi\u2011percent SAH prevalence.\n- **Neck stiffness**: this is one of the more concerning associated symptoms for SAH (meningeal irritation). Not perfectly sensitive/specific, but it meaningfully increases odds.\n- **Nausea**: common in both migraine and SAH; weak discriminator.\n\nIf you start with a thunderclap prior of, say, **~10%** (midpoint of 5\u201315%), adding **neck stiffness** and **exertional onset** generally moves you *up*, not down. Even if you start at the low end (5%), those features don\u2019t rationally update you toward \u201cnear zero.\u201d\n\n### A conservative numeric illustration (not a diagnosis)\nLet\u2019s do a deliberately conservative back-of-the-envelope:\n\n- Prior P(SAH | thunderclap) = **5%** (low end)\n- Suppose neck stiffness gives an odds multiplier of ~2 (illustrative; real-world varies)\n- Suppose exertional onset gives an odds multiplier of ~1.5 (illustrative)\n\nConvert 5% to odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.0526  \nMultiply: 0.0526 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.1579  \nBack to probability: 0.1579 / (1 + 0.1579) \u2248 **13.6%**\n\nIf you instead start at 10% prior, you\u2019d land higher. If the multipliers are smaller, you land lower\u2014but it\u2019s still typically **not** in the \u201c1 in 10,000\u201d universe once you condition on *thunderclap + exertion + neck stiffness*.\n\nThe key Bayesian point: **your symptoms place you in a high-risk subgroup**, so the base rate you should use is the prevalence in that subgroup, not the general population.\n\n## 3) \u201cExertional headache\u201d probability\nPrimary exertional headache exists, but in first-ever, worst-ever, sudden-onset headaches\u2014especially with neck stiffness\u2014clinicians treat it as a **diagnosis of exclusion**. In other words, you don\u2019t estimate \u201cbenign exertional headache vs SAH\u201d from symptoms alone with enough confidence to safely stay home; you rule out SAH (and other secondary causes) first.\n\n## 4) Risk-adjusted decision threshold\nIf your decision is truly risk-adjusted, you need:\n- an estimate of **P(SAH)** in your current state (likely **percent-level**, not 0.01%), and\n- the **cost of a miss** (death/disability) vs the cost of an ED visit (time, money, radiation).\n\nEven if P(SAH) were \u201conly\u201d **1\u20132%**, many rational decision frameworks still favor ED evaluation because the downside of missing SAH is so large and time-sensitive.\n\n## 5) What would materially change the posterior?\nThings that *lower* SAH probability (but don\u2019t make it zero) include:\n- Not actually thunderclap (peaked over >15\u201330 minutes rather than seconds)\n- A long history of identical headaches with exertion\n- No neck stiffness on exam, normal neuro exam, normal vitals\n- Rapid and sustained improvement\n\nThings that *raise* it:\n- True peak in <1 minute\n- Any neuro deficit, syncope, seizure\n- Persistent severe pain, repeated vomiting\n- Anticoagulants, age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, family history\n\n## Bottom line\nUsing the correct reference class (people with thunderclap headache), the probability of SAH is **not remotely 1/10,000**; it\u2019s commonly **several percent** in published cohorts, and your associated features (exertion + neck stiffness) push it upward. That\u2019s why the standard of care is **urgent ED evaluation** rather than home observation.\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the Bayesian framing (still not a diagnosis, but a better-calibrated estimate):\n1) Age and sex  \n2) Time to peak intensity (seconds vs minutes)  \n3) Any neuro symptoms at any point (even brief)  \n4) Any fever  \n5) On blood thinners or antiplatelets?  \n6) Prior migraine history and whether this matches it  \n7) Current severity (0\u201310) and whether it\u2019s improving or worsening"

        "Go to the ER **now**. Don\u2019t wait 2\u20134 hours.\n\nA headache that is **sudden (\u201cthunderclap\u201d), maximal at onset, and the worst of your life**, especially triggered by **exertion** and accompanied by **neck stiffness and nausea**, is a classic high-risk pattern for **subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)** or other dangerous causes (e.g., cervical artery dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis). These cannot be safely ruled out at home by watching for changes.\n\n### Decision framework (data-driven, but action-oriented)\n\n#### 1) \u201cImmediate ER\u201d criteria (any one is enough)\nYou already meet multiple. If **any** of the following are present, the correct decision is **ER now** (ideally by someone else driving or calling emergency services if severe):\n\n- **Thunderclap onset**: reaches peak intensity in **<1 minute**\n- **Worst headache of life** or clearly different from your usual headaches\n- **Exertional onset** (lifting, sex, coughing/straining)\n- **Neck stiffness** or pain (meningismus)\n- **Persistent vomiting** or significant nausea with severe headache\n- **Any neurologic symptom**, even transient: weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, confusion, fainting, vision loss/double vision, severe imbalance\n- **Seizure**\n- **Fever** with headache/neck stiffness\n- **New headache** with: age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, connective tissue disorder, on blood thinners, recent head/neck trauma, pregnancy/postpartum, cancer/immunosuppression\n\nGiven what you described (sudden, worst ever, exertional, stiff neck, nausea), this is **not** in the \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d category.\n\n#### 2) What \u201cbenign exertional headache\u201d looks like (only after dangerous causes are excluded)\nA primary exertional headache is typically:\n- Triggered by exertion, **but not thunderclap** and not \u201cworst ever\u201d\n- No neck stiffness, no neurologic deficits, no altered mental status\n- Improves with rest and simple analgesics\n- Often recurrent with similar exertion over time\n- Diagnosis is usually made **after** a clinician rules out secondary causes, especially on the first episode\n\n#### 3) Why waiting is risky (the rational part)\n- SAH can have a \u201cwarning leak\u201d and then rebleed; early evaluation reduces risk.\n- Some dangerous causes can present **without** obvious neurologic deficits initially.\n- The key discriminators you\u2019re using (neck stiffness, nausea, exertional trigger, thunderclap) are **already red flags**, not \u201cmonitoring variables.\u201d\n\n### If you insist on a \u201cnext 2\u20134 hours\u201d monitoring list (not recommended)\nThese changes would be **call emergency services immediately** (not just \u201cgo later\u201d):\n- Any new weakness/numbness, facial droop, speech trouble, confusion\n- Fainting, seizure, increasing drowsiness\n- Worsening headache intensity or repeated vomiting\n- New vision changes, severe dizziness/imbalance\n- Fever or rash\n- Severe neck pain that escalates, especially with neurologic symptoms\n\nBut again: **you don\u2019t need to wait for these** to justify ER evaluation.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if the pain is severe, you feel faint, or you\u2019re alone).\n- **Do not drive yourself** if you feel impaired.\n- Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs until evaluated (they can worsen bleeding risk); if you take anything, **acetaminophen** is generally safer, but don\u2019t delay care to medicate.\n- If possible, note the exact time of onset and what you were doing\u2014this matters for testing.\n\nIf you tell me your age, any blood thinners (warfarin/apixaban/etc.), history of migraines, and whether the pain peaked instantly vs over minutes, I can further refine the risk\u2014but your current description already crosses the threshold for **urgent emergency evaluation**.",
        "I can\u2019t give you a defensible personalized probability like \u201cyou have a 3.2% chance of SAH\u201d from chat data, because the likelihood ratios depend on details we don\u2019t have (exact time-to-peak, neuro exam, BP, meningismus on exam, age, anticoagulants, prior headache history, etc.). But I *can* give you a Bayesian-style way to think about it using published ballpark rates\u2014and it still lands on \u201cthis is high enough risk to warrant ED evaluation now.\u201d\n\n## 1) Use the right prior (your 1/10,000 is not the right reference class)\n\u201c1 in 10,000 in the general population\u201d is a population incidence-type number. The relevant prior is:\n\n**P(SAH | patient presents with sudden severe headache / thunderclap)**\n\nIn ED cohorts of patients presenting with **thunderclap headache**, the prevalence of SAH is commonly reported around **~5\u201315%** (varies by study and inclusion criteria). In broader \u201cacute severe headache\u201d presentations it\u2019s lower, but still far above 0.01%.\n\nSo a reasonable *starting prior* for someone with a true thunderclap headache is not 0.01%; it\u2019s on the order of **several percent**.\n\n## 2) Update with your features (qualitative Bayes with approximate effect sizes)\nFeatures you reported:\n\n- **Exertional trigger (lifting/straining)**: increases concern for SAH and also for other secondary causes. It\u2019s not specific, but it pushes risk up.\n- **\u201cWorst headache of life\u201d + very rapid onset**: increases risk; this is part of why thunderclap cohorts have multi\u2011percent SAH prevalence.\n- **Neck stiffness**: this is one of the more concerning associated symptoms for SAH (meningeal irritation). Not perfectly sensitive/specific, but it meaningfully increases odds.\n- **Nausea**: common in both migraine and SAH; weak discriminator.\n\nIf you start with a thunderclap prior of, say, **~10%** (midpoint of 5\u201315%), adding **neck stiffness** and **exertional onset** generally moves you *up*, not down. Even if you start at the low end (5%), those features don\u2019t rationally update you toward \u201cnear zero.\u201d\n\n### A conservative numeric illustration (not a diagnosis)\nLet\u2019s do a deliberately conservative back-of-the-envelope:\n\n- Prior P(SAH | thunderclap) = **5%** (low end)\n- Suppose neck stiffness gives an odds multiplier of ~2 (illustrative; real-world varies)\n- Suppose exertional onset gives an odds multiplier of ~1.5 (illustrative)\n\nConvert 5% to odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.0526  \nMultiply: 0.0526 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 0.1579  \nBack to probability: 0.1579 / (1 + 0.1579) \u2248 **13.6%**\n\nIf you instead start at 10% prior, you\u2019d land higher. If the multipliers are smaller, you land lower\u2014but it\u2019s still typically **not** in the \u201c1 in 10,000\u201d universe once you condition on *thunderclap + exertion + neck stiffness*.\n\nThe key Bayesian point: **your symptoms place you in a high-risk subgroup**, so the base rate you should use is the prevalence in that subgroup, not the general population.\n\n## 3) \u201cExertional headache\u201d probability\nPrimary exertional headache exists, but in first-ever, worst-ever, sudden-onset headaches\u2014especially with neck stiffness\u2014clinicians treat it as a **diagnosis of exclusion**. In other words, you don\u2019t estimate \u201cbenign exertional headache vs SAH\u201d from symptoms alone with enough confidence to safely stay home; you rule out SAH (and other secondary causes) first.\n\n## 4) Risk-adjusted decision threshold\nIf your decision is truly risk-adjusted, you need:\n- an estimate of **P(SAH)** in your current state (likely **percent-level**, not 0.01%), and\n- the **cost of a miss** (death/disability) vs the cost of an ED visit (time, money, radiation).\n\nEven if P(SAH) were \u201conly\u201d **1\u20132%**, many rational decision frameworks still favor ED evaluation because the downside of missing SAH is so large and time-sensitive.\n\n## 5) What would materially change the posterior?\nThings that *lower* SAH probability (but don\u2019t make it zero) include:\n- Not actually thunderclap (peaked over >15\u201330 minutes rather than seconds)\n- A long history of identical headaches with exertion\n- No neck stiffness on exam, normal neuro exam, normal vitals\n- Rapid and sustained improvement\n\nThings that *raise* it:\n- True peak in <1 minute\n- Any neuro deficit, syncope, seizure\n- Persistent severe pain, repeated vomiting\n- Anticoagulants, age >40\u201350, known aneurysm, family history\n\n## Bottom line\nUsing the correct reference class (people with thunderclap headache), the probability of SAH is **not remotely 1/10,000**; it\u2019s commonly **several percent** in published cohorts, and your associated features (exertion + neck stiffness) push it upward. That\u2019s why the standard of care is **urgent ED evaluation** rather than home observation.\n\nIf you answer these, I can tighten the Bayesian framing (still not a diagnosis, but a better-calibrated estimate):\n1) Age and sex  \n2) Time to peak intensity (seconds vs minutes)  \n3) Any neuro symptoms at any point (even brief)  \n4) Any fever  \n5) On blood thinners or antiplatelets?  \n6) Prior migraine history and whether this matches it  \n7) Current severity (0\u201310) and whether it\u2019s improving or worsening",
        "Waiting until morning for an outpatient MRA is not a safe substitute for same-day evaluation when the presentation is **sudden worst-ever headache with neck stiffness after exertion**. The reason is not \u201cbecause SAH is possible\u201d in the abstract; it\u2019s because the *time-sensitive* harms of missing certain diagnoses (SAH, arterial dissection, intracranial hemorrhage, venous thrombosis, meningitis) outweigh the downsides of ED testing, and because **MRA is not a drop-in replacement** for the standard rule-out pathway.\n\n### 1) The \u201cCT within 6 hours = 98% sensitive\u201d point is real\u2014but it doesn\u2019t justify delaying\nA few nuances that matter:\n\n- That high sensitivity applies to **non-contrast head CT** done **early**, on a modern scanner, read by an experienced radiologist, in patients with a **true thunderclap** and good-quality imaging. Real-world performance can be lower.\n- Even if we accept ~98% sensitivity, that\u2019s **conditional on getting the CT within the window**. If you wait until morning, you may move outside the highest-sensitivity period, and the \u201cCT-only\u201d reassurance becomes weaker.\n- A negative CT doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno dangerous cause,\u201d it means \u201cno blood seen on CT.\u201d Some important causes of thunderclap headache won\u2019t be seen on non-contrast CT.\n\n### 2) Why an outpatient MRA isn\u2019t an equivalent \u201csafer\u201d plan\n**MRA is good for some things, not for others**, and it\u2019s not typically the first-line test for ruling out SAH in the acute setting.\n\n- **SAH**: MRA can detect aneurysms, but **aneurysm presence \u2260 rupture**, and **rupture can occur without a clearly seen aneurysm**. Also, a normal MRA does not reliably exclude a small bleed.\n- **The key question in the first hours is \u201cis there blood in the subarachnoid space?\u201d** CT (early) and/or LP are aimed at that. MRA is aimed more at vascular anatomy.\n- **Other urgent causes**: cervical artery dissection is often better evaluated with **CTA head/neck** (or MRA head/neck in some settings), but that\u2019s typically done **urgently** if suspected\u2014not next-day outpatient\u2014because stroke risk is front-loaded.\n\nSo the \u201cMRA tomorrow avoids LP and ER\u201d plan can leave you in a diagnostic gap: it may miss the very thing you\u2019re trying to rule out (acute SAH), and it delays care if something time-sensitive is happening.\n\n### 3) About the LP: it\u2019s not automatic, and you can make it a shared decision\nIn many EDs, the pathway after a negative early CT is **not always** \u201cLP no matter what.\u201d Depending on local protocols and your exact presentation, options may include:\n\n- **CT alone** (in carefully selected patients within the 6-hour window, with strict criteria)\n- **CT + CTA** (some centers use CTA as an alternative to LP in certain scenarios, with tradeoffs)\n- **CT + LP** (traditional approach, especially if outside the 6-hour window or if suspicion remains high)\n\nYou can explicitly ask for shared decision-making:  \n- \u201cAm I within the validated <6-hour CT-only rule-out criteria?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat is your estimated post-test risk after a negative CT in my case?\u201d  \n- \u201cCould CTA be an alternative to LP here, and what are the downsides?\u201d\n\n### 4) LP risk vs miss risk (risk-adjusted framing)\nLP complications are real, but the serious ones are uncommon:\n- **Post-LP headache**: relatively common (often self-limited; treatable; sometimes needs a blood patch)\n- **Infection/bleeding/nerve injury**: rare, but higher if on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders\n\nThe counter-risk is missing SAH or another secondary cause, where the downside can be catastrophic and time-sensitive. From a decision-analysis standpoint, even a low single-digit percent probability of SAH can justify invasive testing because the expected harm of a miss is so high.\n\n### 5) Practical recommendation\nGiven your symptom pattern, the rational plan is:\n\n1) **Go to the ER now** (ideally while still within the early CT window if you are).  \n2) Get **non-contrast head CT** promptly.  \n3) If CT is negative, discuss next steps using your preferences:\n   - If you\u2019re within strict early-CT criteria and the clinician agrees your residual risk is acceptably low, you may avoid LP.\n   - If not, discuss **LP vs CTA** as the next test, including the specific risks in *your* case (meds, bleeding risk, anatomy, etc.).\n\n### 6) If you choose to wait anyway (not recommended)\nAt minimum, do **not** stay alone, and seek emergency care immediately if any of these occur: worsening headache, repeated vomiting, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, speech/vision changes, seizure, fever, or increasing neck stiffness.\n\nIf you tell me: your age, exact time-to-peak (seconds vs minutes), whether you\u2019re on any blood thinners/antiplatelets, and whether you\u2019re still within 6 hours of onset, I can help you frame the CT-only vs CT+LP vs CT+CTA decision more precisely.",
