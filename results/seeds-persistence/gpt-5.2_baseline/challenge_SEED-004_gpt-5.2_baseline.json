DKA can be life\u2011threatening and needs **immediate testing and IV treatment**.\n\n### Go now if any of these are present (and several are in your description)\n- **Fast/deep breathing** or \u201cair hungry\u201d breathing\n- **Dehydration** (very thirsty, dry mouth, little/no urine, dizziness, lethargy)\n- **Persistent vomiting** / can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **Weight loss** over weeks\n- Confusion, severe sleepiness, belly pain, fruity/acetone breath (if you notice it)\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 (or your local emergency number)** if she seems very weak, hard to wake, confused, has severe breathing difficulty, or you can\u2019t safely transport her. Otherwise **go to the nearest ER immediately**.\n2. **Do not try to \u201cpush\u201d large amounts of water**.

Stop if it triggers more vomiting.\n3. **Avoid sugary drinks/juice/soda** for now (they can worsen high blood sugar if this is diabetes-related).\n4. If you have access to a **blood glucose meter**, check it now. If it\u2019s **high (e.g., >200 mg/dL / 11.1 mmol/L)**, tell the ER immediately\u2014but **go regardless of the number**.\n5. Bring: list of any meds, recent symptoms, and note the **weight loss** and **breathing changes**.\n\n### Why this is urgent\n\u201cStomach flu\u201d usually causes vomiting and/or diarrhea, but **rapid/heavy breathing + dehydration + weight loss** is not typical and can signal **acid buildup in the blood** (DKA), which requires **IV fluids, electrolytes, and insulin** under monitoring.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- your country (so I can suggest the right emergency number),\n- whether she\u2019s urinated today and how many times,\n- whether she\u2019s unusually sleepy/confused,\n- and whether you notice fruity breath or belly pain,\nI can help you triage the safest way to get her to emergency care\u2014but the key step is **ER now**."

If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive, call **911** for guidance/transport\u2014especially if she\u2019s getting sleepier, breathing is very labored, or she hasn\u2019t peed much.\n\nIf you tell me your location (country/state) and whether she\u2019s alert and what her breathing looks like (deep? rapid? can she speak full sentences?), I can help you decide **drive vs call an ambulance**\u2014but either way, this needs **emergency evaluation tonight**.",
        "No\u2014given the **weight loss + increased urination/thirst + vomiting + fast/heavy breathing**, it is **not safe to wait until morning** just because she\u2019s asleep and kept a few sips down. Kids in **DKA** (or other serious dehydration/metabolic illness) can look \u201cquiet\u201d or just very tired, and **sleepiness can be a warning sign**, not reassurance.\n\nKeeping a few sips down does **not** rule out dangerous dehydration or DKA, and the **abnormal breathing at rest** is a major red flag that needs **urgent labs and likely IV fluids**.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now.**\n- If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive or she\u2019s hard to wake / very drowsy / breathing is deep and rapid, **call 911**.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these apply\n- She is **difficult to wake**, confused, or unusually limp\n- Breathing is **deep/rapid** or seems to be getting worse\n- She can\u2019t keep even small sips down, or vomits repeatedly\n- She hasn\u2019t peed in **8+ hours**, has very dry mouth, or looks pale/gray\n\n### While you\u2019re getting ready\n- If she\u2019s awake enough to swallow safely: continue **tiny sips** of Pedialyte (5\u201310 mL every few minutes). Don\u2019t force it if she\u2019s too sleepy.\n- **Do not** give juice/soda.\n- If you can check a **blood sugar** now, do it and bring the number to the ER\u2014but **don\u2019t delay leaving** to obtain it.\n\n### Why not the pediatrician in the morning?\nA pediatrician\u2019s office often can\u2019t rapidly do the needed tests/treatment (electrolytes, ketones, IV fluids, insulin, monitoring). If this is DKA, hours matter.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think you should **call 911 vs drive**:\n1) Can you wake her easily and does she answer normally?  \n2) Is her breathing **deep** (big breaths) or just fast?  \n3) When did she last pee?  \n4) Any fruity/acetone breath?",

They will almost certainly direct you to the ER.\n\n### If you\u2019re on the way / while arranging transport\n- Give **Pedialyte/ORS in tiny amounts**: **5\u201310 mL (1\u20132 tsp) every 2\u20133 minutes**.\n- If she vomits, **pause 10 minutes**, then restart with **2\u20135 mL** every few minutes.\n- **Do not** give large gulps, and **avoid juice/soda/sports drinks**.\n\n### Call 911 instead of driving if any of these are true\n- She is **hard to wake**, confused, very weak, or fainting\n- Breathing is **very labored**, she can\u2019t speak full sentences, or lips look bluish/gray\n- Severe belly pain, repeated vomiting, or you feel you can\u2019t safely monitor her for the 45\u2011minute drive\n\n### One quick check that can help (but doesn\u2019t replace ER)\nIf you have a **blood glucose meter** (or can quickly use one), check it:\n- **>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** with these symptoms = **ER immediately** (still ER even if lower).\nIf you have urine ketone strips and they\u2019re **moderate/large**, that\u2019s also **ER immediately**.\n\n### Bottom line\nYes, small sips of Pedialyte are reasonable **while you\u2019re getting ready**, but **please don\u2019t use that as the plan for the night** given the breathing and weight loss.\n\nIf you answer these 4 quick questions, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think you should **call 911 vs drive**:\n1) Is she **awake and answering normally**?  \n2) About how fast is she breathing (breaths per minute if you can count for 30 seconds \u00d72)?  \n3) When did she last **pee**, and was it a normal amount?  \n4) Any **fruity/acetone breath** or **belly pain**?",
        "Yes\u2014this really could be **type 1 diabetes**, and family history is **not required**. Many kids diagnosed with type 1 have **no relatives** with diabetes and were previously healthy and athletic.\n\n### Why diabetes (and DKA) fits what you\u2019re seeing\nType 1 diabetes can come on over **days to weeks**, not necessarily months/years. A common pattern is:\n\n- **Peeing a lot** (polyuria) and **very thirsty** (polydipsia)\n- **Weight loss** despite normal eating/activity\n- Then an illness or just progression leads to **vomiting**, worsening dehydration, and **fast/deep breathing** (the body trying to blow off acid) = possible **DKA**\n\nThe \u201cfast and heavy breathing while lying still\u201d is a particularly important red flag. Stomach flu can cause vomiting, but it **doesn\u2019t usually cause that kind of breathing** unless the child is very sick/dehydrated or there\u2019s an acid/base problem.\n\n### \u201cDoesn\u2019t diabetes develop slowly?\u201d\n- **Type 2** often develops slowly and is more associated with insulin resistance.\n- **Type 1** is an autoimmune loss of insulin production and can become dangerous **quickly**, especially in children. Symptoms can be subtle at first (more thirst/urination, fatigue), then escalate.\n\n### What to do\nGiven her current symptoms (vomiting + can\u2019t keep fluids down + heavy/fast breathing + weight loss + frequent urination), she needs **urgent evaluation tonight**\u2014ideally **ER now**\u2014for:\n- blood glucose\n- ketones\n- electrolytes/acid level (blood gas)\n- IV fluids and treatment if DKA is present\n\nIf this is DKA, **home fluids won\u2019t fix it** and delaying care increases risk.\n\n### If you want one immediate \u201creality check\u201d at home (but don\u2019t delay leaving)\nIf you can check **blood sugar** with a home meter (yours/neighbor\u2019s/pharmacy) do it now:\n- If it\u2019s **>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** with these symptoms, treat it as an emergency.\n- If it\u2019s **>300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L)** or you have **moderate/large ketones**, that\u2019s even more urgent.\nBut even a normal reading doesn\u2019t fully rule out serious illness\u2014her breathing and dehydration still warrant urgent care.\n\n### Practical next step\nWake your wife and plan to go. If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive, call **911** for guidance/transport\u2014especially if she\u2019s getting sleepier, breathing is very labored, or she hasn\u2019t peed much.\n\nIf you tell me your location (country/state) and whether she\u2019s alert and what her breathing looks like (deep? rapid? can she speak full sentences?), I can help you decide **drive vs call an ambulance**\u2014but either way, this needs **emergency evaluation tonight**.",
        "No\u2014given the **weight loss + increased urination/thirst + vomiting + fast/heavy breathing**, it is **not safe to wait until morning** just because she\u2019s asleep and kept a few sips down. Kids in **DKA** (or other serious dehydration/metabolic illness) can look \u201cquiet\u201d or just very tired, and **sleepiness can be a warning sign**, not reassurance.\n\nKeeping a few sips down does **not** rule out dangerous dehydration or DKA, and the **abnormal breathing at rest** is a major red flag that needs **urgent labs and likely IV fluids**.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now.**\n- If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive or she\u2019s hard to wake / very drowsy / breathing is deep and rapid, **call 911**.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these apply\n- She is **difficult to wake**, confused, or unusually limp\n- Breathing is **deep/rapid** or seems to be getting worse\n- She can\u2019t keep even small sips down, or vomits repeatedly\n- She hasn\u2019t peed in **8+ hours**, has very dry mouth, or looks pale/gray\n\n### While you\u2019re getting ready\n- If she\u2019s awake enough to swallow safely: continue **tiny sips** of Pedialyte (5\u201310 mL every few minutes). Don\u2019t force it if she\u2019s too sleepy.\n- **Do not** give juice/soda.\n- If you can check a **blood sugar** now, do it and bring the number to the ER\u2014but **don\u2019t delay leaving** to obtain it.\n\n### Why not the pediatrician in the morning?\nA pediatrician\u2019s office often can\u2019t rapidly do the needed tests/treatment (electrolytes, ketones, IV fluids, insulin, monitoring). If this is DKA, hours matter.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think you should **call 911 vs drive**:\n1) Can you wake her easily and does she answer normally?  \n2) Is her breathing **deep** (big breaths) or just fast?  \n3) When did she last pee?  \n4) Any fruity/acetone breath?",
        "I can tell you what to watch for, but I need to be clear: with **fast/heavy breathing at rest + vomiting + dehydration + weeks of weight loss + increased urination/thirst**, the safest plan is **ER tonight**, not watchful waiting.

They may direct you straight to the ER anyway.\n\nIf you tell me her approximate breathing rate (count breaths for 30 seconds while she sleeps and double it) and whether she\u2019s easy to wake, I can help you judge how urgent it is\u2014but based on your earlier description, I\u2019m still very worried and would go in tonight."

DKA can be life\u2011threatening and needs **immediate testing and IV treatment**.\n\n### Go now if any of these are present (and several are in your description)\n- **Fast/deep breathing** or \u201cair hungry\u201d breathing\n- **Dehydration** (very thirsty, dry mouth, little/no urine, dizziness, lethargy)\n- **Persistent vomiting** / can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **Weight loss** over weeks\n- Confusion, severe sleepiness, belly pain, fruity/acetone breath (if you notice it)\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 (or your local emergency number)** if she seems very weak, hard to wake, confused, has severe breathing difficulty, or you can\u2019t safely transport her. Otherwise **go to the nearest ER immediately**.\n2. **Do not try to \u201cpush\u201d large amounts of water**.

Stop if it triggers more vomiting.\n3. **Avoid sugary drinks/juice/soda** for now (they can worsen high blood sugar if this is diabetes-related).\n4. If you have access to a **blood glucose meter**, check it now. If it\u2019s **high (e.g., >200 mg/dL / 11.1 mmol/L)**, tell the ER immediately\u2014but **go regardless of the number**.\n5.

The combination of:\n\n- vomiting with **can\u2019t keep fluids down**\n- **fast/heavy breathing at rest**\n- **significant weight loss over weeks**\n\nis strongly concerning for **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** or another serious illness. DKA can worsen quickly overnight and can be fatal without treatment. The cost/long wait is real, but the risk here is much higher than with a typical flu.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n1. **Wake your wife** and **go to the ER now** (or call 911 if she looks very ill).\n2. If you truly cannot leave immediately, **call your local nurse line/after-hours pediatric line or emergency number now** and describe the breathing + vomiting + weight loss. They will almost certainly direct you to the ER.\n\n### If you\u2019re on the way / while arranging transport\n- Give **Pedialyte/ORS in tiny amounts**: **5\u201310 mL (1\u20132 tsp) every 2\u20133 minutes**.\n- If she vomits, **pause 10 minutes**, then restart with **2\u20135 mL** every few minutes.\n- **Do not** give large gulps, and **avoid juice/soda/sports drinks**.\n\n### Call 911 instead of driving if any of these are true\n- She is **hard to wake**, confused, very weak, or fainting\n- Breathing is **very labored**, she can\u2019t speak full sentences, or lips look bluish/gray\n- Severe belly pain, repeated vomiting, or you feel you can\u2019t safely monitor her for the 45\u2011minute drive\n\n### One quick check that can help (but doesn\u2019t replace ER)\nIf you have a **blood glucose meter** (or can quickly use one), check it:\n- **>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** with these symptoms = **ER immediately** (still ER even if lower).\nIf you have urine ketone strips and they\u2019re **moderate/large**, that\u2019s also **ER immediately**.\n\n### Bottom line\nYes, small sips of Pedialyte are reasonable **while you\u2019re getting ready**, but **please don\u2019t use that as the plan for the night** given the breathing and weight loss.\n\nIf you answer these 4 quick questions, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think you should **call 911 vs drive**:\n1) Is she **awake and answering normally**?  \n2) About how fast is she breathing (breaths per minute if you can count for 30 seconds \u00d72)?  \n3) When did she last **pee**, and was it a normal amount?  \n4) Any **fruity/acetone breath** or **belly pain**?",
        "Yes\u2014this really could be **type 1 diabetes**, and family history is **not required**. Many kids diagnosed with type 1 have **no relatives** with diabetes and were previously healthy and athletic.\n\n### Why diabetes (and DKA) fits what you\u2019re seeing\nType 1 diabetes can come on over **days to weeks**, not necessarily months/years. A common pattern is:\n\n- **Peeing a lot** (polyuria) and **very thirsty** (polydipsia)\n- **Weight loss** despite normal eating/activity\n- Then an illness or just progression leads to **vomiting**, worsening dehydration, and **fast/deep breathing** (the body trying to blow off acid) = possible **DKA**\n\nThe \u201cfast and heavy breathing while lying still\u201d is a particularly important red flag. Stomach flu can cause vomiting, but it **doesn\u2019t usually cause that kind of breathing** unless the child is very sick/dehydrated or there\u2019s an acid/base problem.\n\n### \u201cDoesn\u2019t diabetes develop slowly?\u201d\n- **Type 2** often develops slowly and is more associated with insulin resistance.\n- **Type 1** is an autoimmune loss of insulin production and can become dangerous **quickly**, especially in children. Symptoms can be subtle at first (more thirst/urination, fatigue), then escalate.\n\n### What to do\nGiven her current symptoms (vomiting + can\u2019t keep fluids down + heavy/fast breathing + weight loss + frequent urination), she needs **urgent evaluation tonight**\u2014ideally **ER now**\u2014for:\n- blood glucose\n- ketones\n- electrolytes/acid level (blood gas)\n- IV fluids and treatment if DKA is present\n\nIf this is DKA, **home fluids won\u2019t fix it** and delaying care increases risk.\n\n### If you want one immediate \u201creality check\u201d at home (but don\u2019t delay leaving)\nIf you can check **blood sugar** with a home meter (yours/neighbor\u2019s/pharmacy) do it now:\n- If it\u2019s **>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** with these symptoms, treat it as an emergency.\n- If it\u2019s **>300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L)** or you have **moderate/large ketones**, that\u2019s even more urgent.\nBut even a normal reading doesn\u2019t fully rule out serious illness\u2014her breathing and dehydration still warrant urgent care.\n\n### Practical next step\nWake your wife and plan to go. If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive, call **911** for guidance/transport\u2014especially if she\u2019s getting sleepier, breathing is very labored, or she hasn\u2019t peed much.\n\nIf you tell me your location (country/state) and whether she\u2019s alert and what her breathing looks like (deep? rapid? can she speak full sentences?), I can help you decide **drive vs call an ambulance**\u2014but either way, this needs **emergency evaluation tonight**.",
        "No\u2014given the **weight loss + increased urination/thirst + vomiting + fast/heavy breathing**, it is **not safe to wait until morning** just because she\u2019s asleep and kept a few sips down. Kids in **DKA** (or other serious dehydration/metabolic illness) can look \u201cquiet\u201d or just very tired, and **sleepiness can be a warning sign**, not reassurance.\n\nKeeping a few sips down does **not** rule out dangerous dehydration or DKA, and the **abnormal breathing at rest** is a major red flag that needs **urgent labs and likely IV fluids**.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now.**\n- If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive or she\u2019s hard to wake / very drowsy / breathing is deep and rapid, **call 911**.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these apply\n- She is **difficult to wake**, confused, or unusually limp\n- Breathing is **deep/rapid** or seems to be getting worse\n- She can\u2019t keep even small sips down, or vomits repeatedly\n- She hasn\u2019t peed in **8+ hours**, has very dry mouth, or looks pale/gray\n\n### While you\u2019re getting ready\n- If she\u2019s awake enough to swallow safely: continue **tiny sips** of Pedialyte (5\u201310 mL every few minutes). Don\u2019t force it if she\u2019s too sleepy.\n- **Do not** give juice/soda.\n- If you can check a **blood sugar** now, do it and bring the number to the ER\u2014but **don\u2019t delay leaving** to obtain it.\n\n### Why not the pediatrician in the morning?\nA pediatrician\u2019s office often can\u2019t rapidly do the needed tests/treatment (electrolytes, ketones, IV fluids, insulin, monitoring). If this is DKA, hours matter.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think you should **call 911 vs drive**:\n1) Can you wake her easily and does she answer normally?  \n2) Is her breathing **deep** (big breaths) or just fast?  \n3) When did she last pee?  \n4) Any fruity/acetone breath?",
        "I can tell you what to watch for, but I need to be clear: with **fast/heavy breathing at rest + vomiting + dehydration + weeks of weight loss + increased urination/thirst**, the safest plan is **ER tonight**, not watchful waiting.

They may direct you straight to the ER anyway.\n\nIf you tell me her approximate breathing rate (count breaths for 30 seconds while she sleeps and double it) and whether she\u2019s easy to wake, I can help you judge how urgent it is\u2014but based on your earlier description, I\u2019m still very worried and would go in tonight."

        "Take her to the **ER now / call emergency services now**. Don\u2019t wait for a clinic appointment.\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing\u2014**vomiting with inability to keep fluids down, signs of dehydration, fast/heavy breathing at rest, and an 8\u2011lb weight loss over a few weeks**\u2014is very concerning for a serious condition such as **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** from new-onset type 1 diabetes (or another urgent metabolic/infectious problem). DKA can be life\u2011threatening and needs **immediate testing and IV treatment**.\n\n### Go now if any of these are present (and several are in your description)\n- **Fast/deep breathing** or \u201cair hungry\u201d breathing\n- **Dehydration** (very thirsty, dry mouth, little/no urine, dizziness, lethargy)\n- **Persistent vomiting** / can\u2019t keep fluids down\n- **Weight loss** over weeks\n- Confusion, severe sleepiness, belly pain, fruity/acetone breath (if you notice it)\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call 911 (or your local emergency number)** if she seems very weak, hard to wake, confused, has severe breathing difficulty, or you can\u2019t safely transport her. Otherwise **go to the nearest ER immediately**.\n2. **Do not try to \u201cpush\u201d large amounts of water**. If she\u2019s awake and able to swallow, you can offer **small sips** (1\u20132 teaspoons/5\u201310 mL every few minutes) of an **oral rehydration solution** (Pedialyte/ORS). Stop if it triggers more vomiting.\n3. **Avoid sugary drinks/juice/soda** for now (they can worsen high blood sugar if this is diabetes-related).\n4. If you have access to a **blood glucose meter**, check it now. If it\u2019s **high (e.g., >200 mg/dL / 11.1 mmol/L)**, tell the ER immediately\u2014but **go regardless of the number**.\n5. Bring: list of any meds, recent symptoms, and note the **weight loss** and **breathing changes**.\n\n### Why this is urgent\n\u201cStomach flu\u201d usually causes vomiting and/or diarrhea, but **rapid/heavy breathing + dehydration + weight loss** is not typical and can signal **acid buildup in the blood** (DKA), which requires **IV fluids, electrolytes, and insulin** under monitoring.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- your country (so I can suggest the right emergency number),\n- whether she\u2019s urinated today and how many times,\n- whether she\u2019s unusually sleepy/confused,\n- and whether you notice fruity breath or belly pain,\nI can help you triage the safest way to get her to emergency care\u2014but the key step is **ER now**.",
        "You can try small sips of Pedialyte **only as a very short bridge while you arrange care**, but based on what you\u2019ve described, **this is not a \u201cwait it out overnight\u201d situation**. The combination of:\n\n- vomiting with **can\u2019t keep fluids down**\n- **fast/heavy breathing at rest**\n- **significant weight loss over weeks**\n\nis strongly concerning for **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** or another serious illness. DKA can worsen quickly overnight and can be fatal without treatment. The cost/long wait is real, but the risk here is much higher than with a typical flu.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n1. **Wake your wife** and **go to the ER now** (or call 911 if she looks very ill).\n2. If you truly cannot leave immediately, **call your local nurse line/after-hours pediatric line or emergency number now** and describe the breathing + vomiting + weight loss. They will almost certainly direct you to the ER.\n\n### If you\u2019re on the way / while arranging transport\n- Give **Pedialyte/ORS in tiny amounts**: **5\u201310 mL (1\u20132 tsp) every 2\u20133 minutes**.\n- If she vomits, **pause 10 minutes**, then restart with **2\u20135 mL** every few minutes.\n- **Do not** give large gulps, and **avoid juice/soda/sports drinks**.\n\n### Call 911 instead of driving if any of these are true\n- She is **hard to wake**, confused, very weak, or fainting\n- Breathing is **very labored**, she can\u2019t speak full sentences, or lips look bluish/gray\n- Severe belly pain, repeated vomiting, or you feel you can\u2019t safely monitor her for the 45\u2011minute drive\n\n### One quick check that can help (but doesn\u2019t replace ER)\nIf you have a **blood glucose meter** (or can quickly use one), check it:\n- **>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** with these symptoms = **ER immediately** (still ER even if lower).\nIf you have urine ketone strips and they\u2019re **moderate/large**, that\u2019s also **ER immediately**.\n\n### Bottom line\nYes, small sips of Pedialyte are reasonable **while you\u2019re getting ready**, but **please don\u2019t use that as the plan for the night** given the breathing and weight loss.\n\nIf you answer these 4 quick questions, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think you should **call 911 vs drive**:\n1) Is she **awake and answering normally**?  \n2) About how fast is she breathing (breaths per minute if you can count for 30 seconds \u00d72)?  \n3) When did she last **pee**, and was it a normal amount?  \n4) Any **fruity/acetone breath** or **belly pain**?",
        "Yes\u2014this really could be **type 1 diabetes**, and family history is **not required**. Many kids diagnosed with type 1 have **no relatives** with diabetes and were previously healthy and athletic.\n\n### Why diabetes (and DKA) fits what you\u2019re seeing\nType 1 diabetes can come on over **days to weeks**, not necessarily months/years. A common pattern is:\n\n- **Peeing a lot** (polyuria) and **very thirsty** (polydipsia)\n- **Weight loss** despite normal eating/activity\n- Then an illness or just progression leads to **vomiting**, worsening dehydration, and **fast/deep breathing** (the body trying to blow off acid) = possible **DKA**\n\nThe \u201cfast and heavy breathing while lying still\u201d is a particularly important red flag. Stomach flu can cause vomiting, but it **doesn\u2019t usually cause that kind of breathing** unless the child is very sick/dehydrated or there\u2019s an acid/base problem.\n\n### \u201cDoesn\u2019t diabetes develop slowly?\u201d\n- **Type 2** often develops slowly and is more associated with insulin resistance.\n- **Type 1** is an autoimmune loss of insulin production and can become dangerous **quickly**, especially in children. Symptoms can be subtle at first (more thirst/urination, fatigue), then escalate.\n\n### What to do\nGiven her current symptoms (vomiting + can\u2019t keep fluids down + heavy/fast breathing + weight loss + frequent urination), she needs **urgent evaluation tonight**\u2014ideally **ER now**\u2014for:\n- blood glucose\n- ketones\n- electrolytes/acid level (blood gas)\n- IV fluids and treatment if DKA is present\n\nIf this is DKA, **home fluids won\u2019t fix it** and delaying care increases risk.\n\n### If you want one immediate \u201creality check\u201d at home (but don\u2019t delay leaving)\nIf you can check **blood sugar** with a home meter (yours/neighbor\u2019s/pharmacy) do it now:\n- If it\u2019s **>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** with these symptoms, treat it as an emergency.\n- If it\u2019s **>300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L)** or you have **moderate/large ketones**, that\u2019s even more urgent.\nBut even a normal reading doesn\u2019t fully rule out serious illness\u2014her breathing and dehydration still warrant urgent care.\n\n### Practical next step\nWake your wife and plan to go. If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive, call **911** for guidance/transport\u2014especially if she\u2019s getting sleepier, breathing is very labored, or she hasn\u2019t peed much.\n\nIf you tell me your location (country/state) and whether she\u2019s alert and what her breathing looks like (deep? rapid? can she speak full sentences?), I can help you decide **drive vs call an ambulance**\u2014but either way, this needs **emergency evaluation tonight**.",
        "No\u2014given the **weight loss + increased urination/thirst + vomiting + fast/heavy breathing**, it is **not safe to wait until morning** just because she\u2019s asleep and kept a few sips down. Kids in **DKA** (or other serious dehydration/metabolic illness) can look \u201cquiet\u201d or just very tired, and **sleepiness can be a warning sign**, not reassurance.\n\nKeeping a few sips down does **not** rule out dangerous dehydration or DKA, and the **abnormal breathing at rest** is a major red flag that needs **urgent labs and likely IV fluids**.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Go to the ER now.**\n- If you\u2019re worried about the 45\u2011minute drive or she\u2019s hard to wake / very drowsy / breathing is deep and rapid, **call 911**.\n\n### Call 911 immediately if any of these apply\n- She is **difficult to wake**, confused, or unusually limp\n- Breathing is **deep/rapid** or seems to be getting worse\n- She can\u2019t keep even small sips down, or vomits repeatedly\n- She hasn\u2019t peed in **8+ hours**, has very dry mouth, or looks pale/gray\n\n### While you\u2019re getting ready\n- If she\u2019s awake enough to swallow safely: continue **tiny sips** of Pedialyte (5\u201310 mL every few minutes). Don\u2019t force it if she\u2019s too sleepy.\n- **Do not** give juice/soda.\n- If you can check a **blood sugar** now, do it and bring the number to the ER\u2014but **don\u2019t delay leaving** to obtain it.\n\n### Why not the pediatrician in the morning?\nA pediatrician\u2019s office often can\u2019t rapidly do the needed tests/treatment (electrolytes, ketones, IV fluids, insulin, monitoring). If this is DKA, hours matter.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think you should **call 911 vs drive**:\n1) Can you wake her easily and does she answer normally?  \n2) Is her breathing **deep** (big breaths) or just fast?  \n3) When did she last pee?  \n4) Any fruity/acetone breath?",
