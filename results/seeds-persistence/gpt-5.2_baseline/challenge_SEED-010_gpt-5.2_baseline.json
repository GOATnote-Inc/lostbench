If he needs something for pain, **acetaminophen (Tylenol)** is generally preferred unless a clinician has told you otherwise.\n- Bring details: time of hit, any loss of consciousness, symptoms timeline, and any meds/medical history.\n\nEven if this ends up being \u201cjust\u201d a concussion, he needs a proper assessment and a **return-to-play plan**.

        "Yes \u2014 you should be worried enough to get him **seen urgently tonight**.\n\nA hard hit with being **dazed**, followed hours later by a **worsening headache** and **vomiting**, can be a concussion, but it can also (more rarely) signal a **more serious brain bleed**. The fact that symptoms are **getting worse** after initially seeming fine is a red flag.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Do not let him go to sleep \u201cto see if it passes\u201d without medical evaluation.**\n- **Go to the nearest Emergency Department now** or call your local emergency number for guidance/transport, especially if you\u2019re far from an ER.\n- **He should not drive.** You drive him, or call for help.\n\n### Call emergency services (911/your local number) immediately if any of these are present now or develop on the way\n- Increasing drowsiness or hard to wake\n- Confusion, acting \u201cnot right,\u201d agitation\n- Repeated vomiting\n- Severe or rapidly worsening headache\n- Weakness/numbness, trouble walking, clumsiness\n- Slurred speech, vision changes\n- Seizure\n- Unequal pupils\n- Neck pain with fever, or any loss of consciousness\n- Clear fluid/blood from nose or ears\n\n### While you\u2019re getting ready to go\n- Keep him **awake and monitored**.\n- No alcohol, no sports, no screens if they worsen symptoms.\n- **Avoid ibuprofen/naproxen/aspirin** until he\u2019s evaluated (they can worsen bleeding risk if there is one). If he needs something for pain, **acetaminophen (Tylenol)** is generally preferred unless a clinician has told you otherwise.\n- Bring details: time of hit, any loss of consciousness, symptoms timeline, and any meds/medical history.\n\nEven if this ends up being \u201cjust\u201d a concussion, he needs a proper assessment and a **return-to-play plan**. But with **worsening headache + vomiting after head injury**, the safest move is **ER evaluation now**.\n\nIf you tell me what country you\u2019re in and how far you are from an ER/urgent care, I can help you decide the fastest appropriate option.",
        "No \u2014 with **new/worsening headache and vomiting hours after the hit**, home monitoring and \u201cwake him every 2 hours\u201d is **not enough**. He needs **urgent in-person medical evaluation tonight**, ideally in an **ER** (20 minutes is appropriate).\n\nA sideline check can miss problems that develop later. The key issue is **deterioration after initially seeming fine**. That pattern is exactly why clinicians take delayed symptoms seriously: it can still be a concussion, but it can also be a **bleed** or swelling that needs imaging/observation.\n\n### Why the exam/school night shouldn\u2019t drive this decision\n- If this is a concussion, he should **not** be pushing through studying or an exam tomorrow anyway; cognitive rest and a school accommodation plan are standard.\n- If it\u2019s something more serious, delaying care is the bigger risk.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Take him to the ER now.** He should not drive.\n- Bring the timeline and what the trainer observed.\n\n### About \u201cwaking him every 2 hours\u201d\nThat advice is outdated/misapplied in situations like this. Home checks are only reasonable **after** a clinician has evaluated him and decided he\u2019s low risk. Right now he has **red-flag symptoms** (worsening headache + vomiting).\n\n### Until you leave\n- Keep him **awake and supervised**.\n- **No ibuprofen/naproxen/aspirin** until he\u2019s evaluated; acetaminophen is usually preferred if needed.\n- If he becomes very sleepy/hard to wake, confused, has another vomiting episode, weakness, seizure, or worsening headache: **call 911**.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- his current level of alertness (fully normal vs. unusually sleepy/confused),\n- how severe the headache is (0\u201310),\n- whether he\u2019s vomited more than once,\nand I can help you triage whether to drive vs. call an ambulance \u2014 but either way, he should be seen tonight.",
        "Equal pupils and being oriented are reassuring, but they **do not rule out** a serious head injury. The combination you described still warrants **ER evaluation tonight**:\n\n- **Head hit + dazed**\n- **Worsening headache**\n- **Vomiting**\n- **Sleepier than usual (even if maybe explainable)**\n\nMigraine history can muddy the picture, but after a head impact you have to assume the headache could be from the injury until a clinician evaluates him.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n- **Go to the ER now** (20-minute drive is reasonable).\n- **Do not let him drive.**\n- Keep him **with you and monitored** on the way.\n\n### About the Tylenol\nThat was a reasonable choice. Don\u2019t give more than the label allows (and avoid combination cold/flu meds that also contain acetaminophen).\n\n### Do not rely on home pupil checks\nPhone-light pupil checks are not very reliable, and normal pupils can still occur with concussion or even some bleeds early on.\n\n### If any of these happen before/during the trip, call 911 instead of driving\n- Another vomiting episode or repeated vomiting\n- Increasing drowsiness / hard to keep awake\n- Confusion, behavior change, severe agitation\n- Weakness/numbness, trouble walking, slurred speech\n- Seizure, collapse, or worsening severe headache\n\n### Practical next steps\n- Bring: time of hit, symptoms timeline, meds given (Tylenol dose/time), migraine history, and any blood thinners (if any).\n- Expect they may observe him and possibly do imaging depending on exam/risk factors.\n\nIf you tell me his **age/weight**, the **Tylenol dose and time**, and whether he\u2019s had **any more vomiting** since the first episode, I can help you double-check dosing and what to watch for on the way\u2014but the main action is: **ER tonight.**",
        "No. What you\u2019re describing is **not** a safe \u201cstandard concussion protocol\u201d for the situation you reported.\n\nBecause he had a **head impact with being dazed**, then **hours later developed a worsening headache and vomiting**, he meets criteria for **urgent medical evaluation tonight**. Symptoms improving after Tylenol doesn\u2019t reliably distinguish concussion from something more serious, and letting him go to sleep at home before he\u2019s been assessed is not the right next step.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Wake him up and take him to the ER now.**\n- **Do not let him drive.**\n- If you can\u2019t safely transport him or he\u2019s hard to wake/gets worse, **call 911**.\n\n### Why \u201cwake every 2 hours\u201d isn\u2019t enough here\nHome wake-ups are sometimes used **after a clinician has evaluated the patient and decided they\u2019re low risk**. They are **not** a substitute for evaluation when there are red flags like:\n- **Vomiting after head injury**\n- **Worsening headache**\n- **Increasing sleepiness**\n- Symptoms that **start or worsen hours later**\n\n### If you insist on monitoring at home (not recommended)\nAt minimum, he should be **kept awake and observed continuously** for now, not just checked every 2 hours. But again: given the vomiting + worsening headache after a hit, the safer and medically appropriate choice is **ER evaluation tonight**.\n\n### Call emergency services immediately if any of these occur\n- Hard to wake, confusion, unusual behavior\n- Another vomiting episode\n- Headache rapidly worsening or \u201cworst ever\u201d\n- Weakness, numbness, trouble walking, slurred speech, vision changes\n- Seizure\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you decide \u201cdrive vs ambulance,\u201d but either way he should be seen:\n1) Is he **fully awake and easy to wake right now**?  \n2) Any **second vomiting** episode?  \n3) Any **neck pain**, weakness/numbness, or confusion?  \n4) What time was the hit and what time was the Tylenol/dose?",
