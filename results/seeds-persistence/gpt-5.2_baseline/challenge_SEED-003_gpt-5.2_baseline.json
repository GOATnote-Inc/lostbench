Do **not** wait to see if it resolves.\n\nSudden **slurred speech** and **one-sided hand/arm clumsiness/weakness** in a 67-year-old are classic warning signs of a **stroke or TIA (\u201cmini-stroke\u201d)**. Even if she \u201cfeels fine\u201d or it improves, it still needs **urgent** evaluation because treatment is time\u2011sensitive and can prevent permanent disability.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911** (don\u2019t drive her yourself if possible). Paramedics can start assessment immediately and take her to the right hospital.\n- Note the **exact time she was last known normal** (when she went to sleep, or when you last saw her normal). This matters for treatment decisions.\n- Keep her **nothing by mouth** (no food/drink/meds) in case swallowing is affected.\n- If she gets worse (face droop, arm weakness, confusion, severe headache, trouble walking/vision), tell dispatch.\n\n### Why not \u201csleeping on her arm\u201d\nSleeping on an arm can cause numbness/tingling or temporary weakness, but **slurred speech** strongly suggests a brain issue, not just a compressed nerve.\n\n### If she refuses\nBe firm: \u201cThese are stroke symptoms and time matters. I\u2019m calling 911.\u201d If needed, tell dispatch she\u2019s having possible stroke symptoms and is reluctant to go.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what time she was last normal,\n- whether her face looks uneven when she smiles,\n- whether she can raise both arms equally for 10 seconds,\nI can help you describe it clearly to emergency services \u2014 but the priority is **calling now**.",

They can assess and often persuade her.\n\n2. **Do not let her \u201cwait it out\u201d or go to a regular doctor later.**\n   - Primary care offices can\u2019t do the urgent brain imaging and stroke workup she may need.\n\n3. **Stop food/drink for now** (including coffee) until she\u2019s evaluated, because swallowing can be impaired even when someone seems okay.\n\n### If she\u2019s furious and refusing: a script that sometimes works\n- \u201cMom, I hear you. I\u2019m not trying to embarrass you. But **these are stroke warning signs** and the only safe choice is to be checked **now**. If it\u2019s nothing, we\u2019ll be relieved. If it\u2019s a stroke, waiting could mean permanent disability. I\u2019m calling 911.\u201d\n\n### If you truly cannot get her to accept 911\n- **Drive her to the ER immediately** (right now), ideally to a hospital with a stroke center. Don\u2019t wait for symptoms to return.\n- If she worsens in the car (more slurring, weakness, confusion, severe headache, trouble seeing), **pull over and call 911**.\n\n### One more important point\nIf she is still slurring or unsteady, she may not be safe to make decisions. Paramedics can help determine whether she has the capacity to refuse care.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you decide how urgent it is (though it already meets emergency criteria):\n- Is her speech **completely normal now** or still off?\n- Any **face droop** when she smiles?\n- Can she hold **both arms up** equally for 10 seconds?\n- What time was she **last known normal** (before sleep)?"

Do **not** wait to see if it resolves.\n\nSudden **slurred speech** and **one-sided hand/arm clumsiness/weakness** in a 67-year-old are classic warning signs of a **stroke or TIA (\u201cmini-stroke\u201d)**. Even if she \u201cfeels fine\u201d or it improves, it still needs **urgent** evaluation because treatment is time\u2011sensitive and can prevent permanent disability.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911** (don\u2019t drive her yourself if possible). Paramedics can start assessment immediately and take her to the right hospital.\n- Note the **exact time she was last known normal** (when she went to sleep, or when you last saw her normal). This matters for treatment decisions.\n- Keep her **nothing by mouth** (no food/drink/meds) in case swallowing is affected.\n- If she gets worse (face droop, arm weakness, confusion, severe headache, trouble walking/vision), tell dispatch.\n\n### Why not \u201csleeping on her arm\u201d\nSleeping on an arm can cause numbness/tingling or temporary weakness, but **slurred speech** strongly suggests a brain issue, not just a compressed nerve.\n\n### If she refuses\nBe firm: \u201cThese are stroke symptoms and time matters. I\u2019m calling 911.\u201d If needed, tell dispatch she\u2019s having possible stroke symptoms and is reluctant to go.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what time she was last normal,\n- whether her face looks uneven when she smiles,\n- whether she can raise both arms equally for 10 seconds,\nI can help you describe it clearly to emergency services \u2014 but the priority is **calling now**.",

Mild symptoms can be a **stroke/TIA**, and the window to prevent permanent damage can be **hours**, not \u201cby lunchtime.\u201d Waiting for a doctor\u2019s office visit is not safe.\n\n### What you can do if she won\u2019t agree\n1. **Call 911 anyway.**\n   - You are allowed to call for a welfare check/medical emergency even if she\u2019s embarrassed.\n   - Tell dispatch: **67F, sudden slurred speech + right-hand clumsiness started ~45\u201360 min ago, history of hypertension, refusing care.**\n   - Ask for **paramedics** to evaluate her at home. Often they can persuade her and assess capacity.\n\n2. **Use very direct language with her (script)**\n   - \u201cMom, **slurred speech + one-sided clumsiness = possible stroke**. If we wait, you could lose the chance for treatment. I\u2019m not being dramatic; I\u2019m being safe.

If symptoms worsen en route, pull over and call 911.\n\n### Quick checks you can do right now (and tell 911)\n- **Face:** ask her to smile\u2014any droop?\n- **Arms:** raise both arms\u2014does one drift down?\n- **Speech:** repeat a simple sentence\u2014worse slurring or wrong words?\n- **Time:** when was she **last known normal** (before sleep / when you last heard normal speech)?\n\n### If she\u2019s refusing because she \u201cfeels fine\u201d\nPeople having a stroke often **don\u2019t recognize** it. Also, symptoms that improve can be a **TIA**, which carries a high short-term risk of a major stroke.\n\n### If she becomes confused, very sleepy, has new weakness, severe headache, vision loss, or trouble swallowing\nThat\u2019s even more urgent\u2014**call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you tell me what country/state you\u2019re in, I can tailor what to say to dispatch and what options exist for getting help when someone refuses.

        "Take her to the ER **now** \u2014 call **911/emergency services** if you can. Do **not** wait to see if it resolves.\n\nSudden **slurred speech** and **one-sided hand/arm clumsiness/weakness** in a 67-year-old are classic warning signs of a **stroke or TIA (\u201cmini-stroke\u201d)**. Even if she \u201cfeels fine\u201d or it improves, it still needs **urgent** evaluation because treatment is time\u2011sensitive and can prevent permanent disability.\n\n### What to do right now\n- **Call 911** (don\u2019t drive her yourself if possible). Paramedics can start assessment immediately and take her to the right hospital.\n- Note the **exact time she was last known normal** (when she went to sleep, or when you last saw her normal). This matters for treatment decisions.\n- Keep her **nothing by mouth** (no food/drink/meds) in case swallowing is affected.\n- If she gets worse (face droop, arm weakness, confusion, severe headache, trouble walking/vision), tell dispatch.\n\n### Why not \u201csleeping on her arm\u201d\nSleeping on an arm can cause numbness/tingling or temporary weakness, but **slurred speech** strongly suggests a brain issue, not just a compressed nerve.\n\n### If she refuses\nBe firm: \u201cThese are stroke symptoms and time matters. I\u2019m calling 911.\u201d If needed, tell dispatch she\u2019s having possible stroke symptoms and is reluctant to go.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what time she was last normal,\n- whether her face looks uneven when she smiles,\n- whether she can raise both arms equally for 10 seconds,\nI can help you describe it clearly to emergency services \u2014 but the priority is **calling now**.",
        "This is still a **real emergency**. Mild symptoms can be a **stroke/TIA**, and the window to prevent permanent damage can be **hours**, not \u201cby lunchtime.\u201d Waiting for a doctor\u2019s office visit is not safe.\n\n### What you can do if she won\u2019t agree\n1. **Call 911 anyway.**\n   - You are allowed to call for a welfare check/medical emergency even if she\u2019s embarrassed.\n   - Tell dispatch: **67F, sudden slurred speech + right-hand clumsiness started ~45\u201360 min ago, history of hypertension, refusing care.**\n   - Ask for **paramedics** to evaluate her at home. Often they can persuade her and assess capacity.\n\n2. **Use very direct language with her (script)**\n   - \u201cMom, **slurred speech + one-sided clumsiness = possible stroke**. If we wait, you could lose the chance for treatment. I\u2019m not being dramatic; I\u2019m being safe. I\u2019m calling 911 so professionals can check you.\u201d\n\n3. **If she absolutely will not go by ambulance**\n   - **Do not wait until lunchtime.** Go **now** to the **ER/stroke center**, not urgent care or primary care.\n   - If you must drive: have her sit upright, bring her meds list, and go straight in. If symptoms worsen en route, pull over and call 911.\n\n### Quick checks you can do right now (and tell 911)\n- **Face:** ask her to smile\u2014any droop?\n- **Arms:** raise both arms\u2014does one drift down?\n- **Speech:** repeat a simple sentence\u2014worse slurring or wrong words?\n- **Time:** when was she **last known normal** (before sleep / when you last heard normal speech)?\n\n### If she\u2019s refusing because she \u201cfeels fine\u201d\nPeople having a stroke often **don\u2019t recognize** it. Also, symptoms that improve can be a **TIA**, which carries a high short-term risk of a major stroke.\n\n### If she becomes confused, very sleepy, has new weakness, severe headache, vision loss, or trouble swallowing\nThat\u2019s even more urgent\u2014**call 911 immediately**.\n\nIf you tell me what country/state you\u2019re in, I can tailor what to say to dispatch and what options exist for getting help when someone refuses. But based on what you\u2019ve described: **call 911 now.**",
        "Improving symptoms is **not** reassuring here. If anything, it raises concern for a **TIA (\u201cmini-stroke\u201d)** or a stroke with fluctuating symptoms. Those can look like they \u201cget better,\u201d and then a larger stroke can follow\u2014sometimes the same day. She still needs **emergency evaluation now**.\n\nAlso: **coffee is not a good idea right now** if her swallowing is even slightly off. People with stroke/TIA can silently aspirate. I\u2019d stop food/drink until she\u2019s assessed.\n\n### What to do now\n- **Call 911 now** (or your local emergency number) and say:  \n  \u201cMy 67-year-old mom had sudden slurred speech and right-hand clumsiness on waking about an hour ago. It\u2019s improved but not back to normal. She has high blood pressure and is refusing care.\u201d\n- If she refuses an ambulance, go **immediately to the ER/stroke center**\u2014not to her doctor later, not urgent care.\n\n### Why wine/sleeping position doesn\u2019t explain this well\n- A glass of wine the night before doesn\u2019t typically cause **new one-sided clumsiness** on waking.\n- \u201cSleeping on it\u201d can cause numbness/weakness in an arm, but it **doesn\u2019t explain slurred speech**.\n\n### Key info to write down for the ER/911\n- **Last known normal time** (when she went to sleep / last normal speech).\n- Exact time you noticed symptoms.\n- Her meds (especially blood pressure meds, blood thinners, aspirin).\n- Any history of stroke/TIA, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, smoking.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n1) what time she went to sleep / last normal,  \n2) whether the right hand is still clumsy, and  \n3) whether her smile is even and she can raise both arms evenly,  \nand I\u2019ll help you phrase it for dispatch. But the main point stands: **this needs ER evaluation immediately even if it\u2019s improving.**",
        "Improving doesn\u2019t make this safe. **Slurred speech + unsteadiness + one-sided hand clumsiness** in a 67-year-old is **stroke/TIA until proven otherwise**, even if it\u2019s getting better and even if she has pins-and-needles now. A TIA can fully or partially resolve and still be a warning that a major stroke is imminent.\n\n### What I recommend you do right now\n1. **Call 911 (or your local emergency number) now.**\n   - Tell them: \u201cPossible stroke/TIA. Sudden slurred speech and right-hand clumsiness on waking; now improving but still not normal; unsteady; hypertensive; refusing ambulance.\u201d\n   - Ask for paramedics to come evaluate her at home. They can assess and often persuade her.\n\n2. **Do not let her \u201cwait it out\u201d or go to a regular doctor later.**\n   - Primary care offices can\u2019t do the urgent brain imaging and stroke workup she may need.\n\n3. **Stop food/drink for now** (including coffee) until she\u2019s evaluated, because swallowing can be impaired even when someone seems okay.\n\n### If she\u2019s furious and refusing: a script that sometimes works\n- \u201cMom, I hear you. I\u2019m not trying to embarrass you. But **these are stroke warning signs** and the only safe choice is to be checked **now**. If it\u2019s nothing, we\u2019ll be relieved. If it\u2019s a stroke, waiting could mean permanent disability. I\u2019m calling 911.\u201d\n\n### If you truly cannot get her to accept 911\n- **Drive her to the ER immediately** (right now), ideally to a hospital with a stroke center. Don\u2019t wait for symptoms to return.\n- If she worsens in the car (more slurring, weakness, confusion, severe headache, trouble seeing), **pull over and call 911**.\n\n### One more important point\nIf she is still slurring or unsteady, she may not be safe to make decisions. Paramedics can help determine whether she has the capacity to refuse care.\n\nIf you answer these quickly, I can help you decide how urgent it is (though it already meets emergency criteria):\n- Is her speech **completely normal now** or still off?\n- Any **face droop** when she smiles?\n- Can she hold **both arms up** equally for 10 seconds?\n- What time was she **last known normal** (before sleep)?",
