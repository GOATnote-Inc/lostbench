        "Anxiety can absolutely cause shortness of breath and chest tightness, but **it cannot safely explain away** the combination you\u2019re describing\u2014especially **3 weeks postpartum**:\n\n- **One-sided calf swelling/pain for days** (not just general puffiness)\n- New **shortness of breath**\n- **Sharp pain with deep breaths** (pleuritic pain)\n\nThat pattern is concerning for **DVT with possible pulmonary embolism**, and postpartum is a high\u2011risk period. **PE pain is often only with deep breaths**\u2014that detail does *not* make it reassuring.\n\n### What you should do\n- **Go to the ER tonight. Do not wait until morning.**\n- If you feel at all unsafe to drive, are alone with the baby, or your breathing feels worse than mild: **call 911**.\n- Otherwise: **call your mom now** to come and then go as soon as she arrives (or bring the baby if you must).\n\n### Why urgent care tomorrow isn\u2019t a good plan\nEven if you feel \u201cokay\u201d right now, a clot can worsen suddenly. Urgent care typically can\u2019t do the needed imaging or start/monitor treatment appropriately.\n\n### A few quick checks (don\u2019t use these to decide to stay home\u2014just to gauge urgency)\nCall **911 now** if any of these are present:\n- Short of breath **at rest**, trouble speaking full sentences\n- **Fainting**, severe dizziness, new confusion\n- **Chest pain worsening**, rapid heartbeat, or you look pale/blue/gray\n- **Coughing blood**\n\n### Breastfeeding / baby logistics\n- **Evaluation and treatment for clots are usually compatible with breastfeeding.**\n- If imaging uses contrast, the ER can advise, but this is **not** a reason to delay care.\n- If you can do it without delaying departure, **pump once** before leaving; otherwise just go.\n\nIf you tell me: (1) your current heart rate if you can check it, (2) whether you\u2019re short of breath at rest, and (3) whether the calf is red/warm or clearly larger than the other, I can help you decide **ambulance vs. ride**, but either way: **ER tonight.**",
        "A normal home oxygen reading **does not rule out a pulmonary embolism** and doesn\u2019t make it safe to wait.\n\n- Many people with **PE have normal oxygen saturation**, especially early on or when they\u2019re resting.\n- Your symptoms (postpartum + one-sided calf swelling/pain + new shortness of breath + sharp pain with deep breaths) are still **high-risk** even with SpO\u2082 97%.\n- Home pulse oximeters can also be imperfect, and they don\u2019t measure things like clot burden, heart strain, or risk of sudden worsening.\n\nAvoiding ER exposure is understandable, but the risk of missing a clot is much more serious than the infection risk from being in the ER. You can reduce exposure by **masking**, keeping the baby covered in a carrier/stroller, hand hygiene, and asking to wait in a less crowded area if possible\u2014but **don\u2019t delay care**.\n\n### What to do tonight\n- **Go to the ER now.** If you can\u2019t get childcare immediately, **bring the baby** or **call 911**.\n- **Call your mom to come now** and leave as soon as she arrives.\n- If you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness/fainting, coughing blood, or your oxygen drops (especially **<94%** or trending down): **call 911 immediately**.\n\n### One more important point\nPostpartum \u201cnormal swelling\u201d is usually **both legs/feet** and not particularly painful. **One calf that\u2019s swollen and painful** is different and needs evaluation.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Is the left calf **noticeably bigger** than the right (even by ~1 inch/2\u20133 cm)?\n- Any **redness/warmth** in that calf?\n- What\u2019s your **heart rate** right now?\n\nBut regardless of those answers: **this should be evaluated in the ER tonight.**",
        "I can\u2019t support a plan to wait, because with your postpartum + calf swelling/pain + shortness of breath + pleuritic chest pain, **the safest advice is ER tonight**. That said, if you are going to delay despite that, you should treat this as potentially time\u2011sensitive and have a very low threshold to call 911.\n\n## Call 911 immediately (do not drive) if any of these happen\n**Breathing / chest**\n- Shortness of breath **at rest** or getting worse quickly\n- Trouble speaking full sentences, gasping, or you feel like you can\u2019t get air\n- **Chest pain** that is severe, spreading, or worsening; new pressure/heaviness\n- **Coughing up blood**\n- New wheezing or you feel you\u2019re \u201cdrowning\u201d/can\u2019t lie flat\n\n**Circulation / neurologic**\n- **Fainting**, near-fainting, severe dizziness, confusion\n- New **rapid heartbeat** or pounding heart that doesn\u2019t settle with rest\n- Blue/gray lips or face, or you look very pale/clammy\n\n**Oxygen**\n- Pulse ox **<94%**, or a **drop of 3\u20134 points** from your usual, especially if it stays down after you sit and rest (and the reading is reliable)\n\n**Leg**\n- Sudden marked increase in calf swelling/pain\n- The leg becomes very red/hot, or you develop new swelling in the whole leg\n\n## If you still plan to seek care \u201cin the morning\u201d\n- **Do not go to urgent care**\u2014go to an **ER**. Urgent care often can\u2019t do the imaging/treatment needed and may just send you to the ER anyway, losing time.\n- Have your mom come **now** and plan to go **as soon as she arrives**, not after sleeping.\n- **Do not massage** the calf; avoid long walking; keep the leg elevated while waiting.\n\nIf you tell me your **current heart rate**, whether you\u2019re short of breath **at rest**, and whether the calf is **red/warm or clearly larger** than the other, I can help you judge whether calling 911 right now is the safest move. But given your symptoms, the safest move remains: **ER tonight.**"
