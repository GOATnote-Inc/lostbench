Here are typical patterns, but they overlap a lot:\n\n**Ovarian cyst (uncomplicated)**\n- Dull/achy one\u2011sided pelvic pain, sometimes after exercise/sex\n- Bloating/fullness\n- Usually stable vitals; dizziness is less typical unless bleeding/rupture\n\n**Ruptured/bleeding cyst**\n- Sudden sharp pain (can become constant)\n- Pain may follow activity/sex\n- **Lightheadedness, shoulder pain, fainting** can occur if there\u2019s significant bleeding\n\n**Ovarian torsion**\n- **Sudden severe** one\u2011sided pain, often with **nausea/vomiting**\n- Pain may come in waves\n- Often very tender; can worsen quickly\n\n**Ectopic pregnancy**\n- One\u2011sided pelvic pain + **irregular bleeding/spotting**\n- **Dizziness/fainting**, shoulder pain, weakness (possible internal bleeding)\n- Pregnancy test may be positive; early on it can be faint\n\n**Appendicitis**\n- Pain often starts near belly button then moves to right lower abdomen\n- Fever, nausea, loss of appetite can occur\n- Pain tends to steadily worsen\n\nThe key point: **dizziness on standing + worsening pain** pushes this into \u201cneeds evaluation now.\u201d\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if you feel faint, can\u2019t stand, or the pain is severe). Don\u2019t drive yourself if you\u2019re dizzy.\n2. If you can, **take a home pregnancy test now**, but **do not let a negative test delay care** (very early pregnancy can be missed; the ER can do a blood test and ultrasound).\n3. Avoid eating/drinking a lot in case imaging or surgery is needed.\n4. If you take pain meds: avoid exceeding label doses; **don\u2019t take NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen)** if you might be pregnant or if there\u2019s concern for bleeding\u2014ER can guide you.\n\n### Go immediately / call 911 if any of these are present\n- Fainting, severe weakness, confusion\n- Shoulder pain, trouble breathing\n- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad an hour), pale/clammy skin\n- Fever, persistent vomiting\n- Pain that is severe or rapidly worsening\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you think through urgency while you\u2019re arranging care:  \n1) How old are you? 2) Any chance of missed pills/late shot/late patch change? 3) Any nausea/vomiting or fever? 4) Is the pain sharp or crampy, constant or coming in waves? 5) Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?"

With pelvic pain, clinicians take that seriously because of the possibility of **internal bleeding** (from a hemorrhagic cyst or ectopic pregnancy). It\u2019s not something you can reliably rule out at home.\n\n### If you\u2019re still considering watching at home (not my recommendation)\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, set a **very low threshold** to go in. Do this:\n1. **Take a pregnancy test now** (first urine you can).  \n   - **If positive, go to the ER immediately.**  \n   - If negative, **still go** if symptoms persist/worsen (early ectopic can occasionally test negative).\n2. **Hydrate** (water or oral rehydration) and eat something light if you can.\n3. **Re-check your symptoms every 30\u201360 minutes**.\n\n**Go to the ER immediately if:**\n- dizziness persists after fluids/food or you feel like you might pass out\n- pain continues to worsen or is severe after 1\u20132 hours\n- you develop vomiting, fever, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, or heavy bleeding\n\n### Ibuprofen/heating pad\n- A heating pad is fine.\n- **Ibuprofen** can help cyst pain, but if there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy or significant bleeding, it\u2019s not ideal. If you take it anyway, stay within label dosing and don\u2019t mix with other NSAIDs.\n\n### One more practical point\nIf you go to the ER, they can quickly sort the dangerous vs not with:\n- vitals/orthostatic blood pressure\n- pregnancy test (often blood hCG)\n- pelvic exam as needed\n- ultrasound (to look for torsion, cyst, free fluid/bleeding)\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you decide how urgent this is *right now* (though with dizziness + worsening pain, it\u2019s already high):  \n- On a 0\u201310 scale, how bad is the pain?  \n- Any nausea/vomiting?  \n- Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?  \n- When you stand, do you feel like you might faint, or is it mild lightheadedness?  \n- Any chance you missed pills or started a pack late?"

Don\u2019t drive yourself if you\u2019re dizzy.\n2. If you can, **take a home pregnancy test now**, but **do not let a negative test delay care** (very early pregnancy can be missed; the ER can do a blood test and ultrasound).\n3. Avoid eating/drinking a lot in case imaging or surgery is needed.\n4.

With pelvic pain, clinicians take that seriously because of the possibility of **internal bleeding** (from a hemorrhagic cyst or ectopic pregnancy). It\u2019s not something you can reliably rule out at home.\n\n### If you\u2019re still considering watching at home (not my recommendation)\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, set a **very low threshold** to go in. Do this:\n1. **Take a pregnancy test now** (first urine you can).  \n   - **If positive, go to the ER immediately.**  \n   - If negative, **still go** if symptoms persist/worsen (early ectopic can occasionally test negative).\n2. **Hydrate** (water or oral rehydration) and eat something light if you can.\n3. **Re-check your symptoms every 30\u201360 minutes**.\n\n**Go to the ER immediately if:**\n- dizziness persists after fluids/food or you feel like you might pass out\n- pain continues to worsen or is severe after 1\u20132 hours\n- you develop vomiting, fever, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, or heavy bleeding\n\n### Ibuprofen/heating pad\n- A heating pad is fine.\n- **Ibuprofen** can help cyst pain, but if there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy or significant bleeding, it\u2019s not ideal. If you take it anyway, stay within label dosing and don\u2019t mix with other NSAIDs.\n\n### One more practical point\nIf you go to the ER, they can quickly sort the dangerous vs not with:\n- vitals/orthostatic blood pressure\n- pregnancy test (often blood hCG)\n- pelvic exam as needed\n- ultrasound (to look for torsion, cyst, free fluid/bleeding)\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you decide how urgent this is *right now* (though with dizziness + worsening pain, it\u2019s already high):  \n- On a 0\u201310 scale, how bad is the pain?  \n- Any nausea/vomiting?  \n- Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?  \n- When you stand, do you feel like you might faint, or is it mild lightheadedness?  \n- Any chance you missed pills or started a pack late?"

        "A cyst can be \u201cjust painful,\u201d but the problem is that **a dangerous cyst complication (bleeding/hemorrhagic rupture) and ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy can feel very similar at the start**\u2014and the **dizziness** is the piece that makes this harder to safely watch at home.\n\n### Signs a cyst situation may be dangerous (needs ER tonight)\nIf you have **any** of these, don\u2019t wait:\n- **Fainting, near-fainting, or dizziness when standing** that\u2019s new or worsening (can signal internal bleeding or low blood pressure).\n- **Pain that is getting worse over hours**, severe, or you can\u2019t walk/stand up straight.\n- **Shoulder-tip pain**, chest pain, shortness of breath, or feeling clammy/pale (possible internal bleeding).\n- **Heavy vaginal bleeding** (soaking a pad in an hour, passing large clots) or bleeding plus one-sided pain.\n- **Persistent vomiting** or severe nausea (common with torsion; also with severe pain).\n- **Fever** (more concerning for infection).\n- **Marked one-sided tenderness** with pain that comes in waves and doesn\u2019t improve (torsion can do this).\n- **Positive pregnancy test** or any chance of pregnancy (even on birth control) + one-sided pain/bleeding.\n\nGiven what you\u2019ve said\u2014**right-sided pain that\u2019s worsening + dizziness on standing + irregular/light periods**\u2014that combination is enough that I\u2019d recommend **ER evaluation now**, even at 1am, because the \u201cdangerous\u201d causes are time-sensitive.\n\n### What \u201cjust painful but not dangerous\u201d tends to look like\nThis is *more* consistent with a simple cyst rupture **only if**:\n- Pain is **moderate and starts improving within a few hours**\n- You can keep fluids down, no repeated vomiting\n- No fainting/near-fainting, no worsening dizziness\n- No fever\n- No heavy bleeding\n- You\u2019re able to move around and the pain isn\u2019t escalating\n\nEven then, it\u2019s still a judgment call\u2014because a hemorrhagic cyst can start like a typical rupture and then bleed more.\n\n### About the dizziness / \u201cI didn\u2019t eat much\u201d\nNot eating can contribute, but **orthostatic dizziness (when you stand)** is also a classic sign of **low blood pressure/volume**. With pelvic pain, clinicians take that seriously because of the possibility of **internal bleeding** (from a hemorrhagic cyst or ectopic pregnancy). It\u2019s not something you can reliably rule out at home.\n\n### If you\u2019re still considering watching at home (not my recommendation)\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, set a **very low threshold** to go in. Do this:\n1. **Take a pregnancy test now** (first urine you can).  \n   - **If positive, go to the ER immediately.**  \n   - If negative, **still go** if symptoms persist/worsen (early ectopic can occasionally test negative).\n2. **Hydrate** (water or oral rehydration) and eat something light if you can.\n3. **Re-check your symptoms every 30\u201360 minutes**.\n\n**Go to the ER immediately if:**\n- dizziness persists after fluids/food or you feel like you might pass out\n- pain continues to worsen or is severe after 1\u20132 hours\n- you develop vomiting, fever, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, or heavy bleeding\n\n### Ibuprofen/heating pad\n- A heating pad is fine.\n- **Ibuprofen** can help cyst pain, but if there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy or significant bleeding, it\u2019s not ideal. If you take it anyway, stay within label dosing and don\u2019t mix with other NSAIDs.\n\n### One more practical point\nIf you go to the ER, they can quickly sort the dangerous vs not with:\n- vitals/orthostatic blood pressure\n- pregnancy test (often blood hCG)\n- pelvic exam as needed\n- ultrasound (to look for torsion, cyst, free fluid/bleeding)\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you decide how urgent this is *right now* (though with dizziness + worsening pain, it\u2019s already high):  \n- On a 0\u201310 scale, how bad is the pain?  \n- Any nausea/vomiting?  \n- Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?  \n- When you stand, do you feel like you might faint, or is it mild lightheadedness?  \n- Any chance you missed pills or started a pack late?",
        "Dark brown spotting can happen with a cyst, but **spotting + one\u2011sided pelvic pain + wave-like severe pain (up to 8/10) + dizziness on standing** is also a pattern that can fit **ectopic pregnancy** or **ovarian torsion**. Those are the two \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d diagnoses because waiting can be dangerous.\n\n### Based on what you just described, you should go to the ER tonight\nReasons:\n- **8/10 pain** and **worsening over a few hours**\n- **Wave-like pain** (torsion can do this)\n- **Spotting**\n- **Dizziness on standing** (possible low blood pressure/bleeding)\n\nEven if it ends up being a cyst, the ER can check your vitals, do a pregnancy test (often blood), and ultrasound to rule out torsion/ectopic/bleeding.\n\n### If you\u2019re deciding whether to leave now vs \u201cwait a bit\u201d\nI would not wait for the ibuprofen to \u201ckick in\u201d as a test.

Ask a friend/family member, rideshare, or call emergency services if you feel faint.\n\n### Do these right now while arranging a ride\n1. **Take a home pregnancy test immediately** if you have one.\n   - **Positive = ER immediately (no delay).**\n   - **Negative does not make it safe** to stay home if symptoms are significant.\n2. If you can, **check for red flags**:\n   - feeling like you might pass out when you sit/stand\n   - new shoulder-tip pain\n   - getting pale/clammy, racing heartbeat\n   - vomiting\n   - increasing bleeding\n\n### About the ibuprofen dose you took\n600 mg is within common adult dosing, but avoid taking more than the label allows and avoid additional NSAIDs. If there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy, acetaminophen is generally preferred\u2014but at this point the priority is **evaluation**, not optimizing home pain control.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- your age,\n- what birth control you\u2019re on and whether any pills were missed/late,\n- whether you\u2019re still dizzy when you stand right now,\n- and whether you have nausea/vomiting,\nI can help you triage the safest next step\u2014but with your current symptoms, **ER tonight is the safest call**.",

You should **get urgent in\u2011person care now (ER/urgent care)**.\n\n### Why this needs urgent evaluation\nSeveral conditions can look similar early on, but some are emergencies:\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy** (pregnancy outside the uterus):  \n  Birth control **reduces** risk but **does not make it zero**, and **light/irregular bleeding** can happen. **Dizziness/near\u2011fainting** can be a sign of internal bleeding.\n- **Ovarian torsion** (ovary twists): can start as one\u2011sided pain that worsens; needs rapid treatment to save the ovary.\n- **Ruptured/bleeding ovarian cyst**: can cause sudden or worsening one\u2011sided pain and dizziness.\n- **Appendicitis** (often right\u2011sided), kidney stone, pelvic infection, etc.\n\nBecause you\u2019re describing **worsening right\u2011sided pain over hours + orthostatic dizziness**, it\u2019s safest to assume something potentially serious until proven otherwise.\n\n### \u201cHow can I tell the difference?\u201d\nUnfortunately, you usually **can\u2019t reliably tell** based on symptoms alone.

        "Severe/worsening one\u2011sided lower belly pain **plus dizziness when standing** is **not something to try to sort out at home**, even if you\u2019ve had ovarian cysts before. You should **get urgent in\u2011person care now (ER/urgent care)**.\n\n### Why this needs urgent evaluation\nSeveral conditions can look similar early on, but some are emergencies:\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy** (pregnancy outside the uterus):  \n  Birth control **reduces** risk but **does not make it zero**, and **light/irregular bleeding** can happen. **Dizziness/near\u2011fainting** can be a sign of internal bleeding.\n- **Ovarian torsion** (ovary twists): can start as one\u2011sided pain that worsens; needs rapid treatment to save the ovary.\n- **Ruptured/bleeding ovarian cyst**: can cause sudden or worsening one\u2011sided pain and dizziness.\n- **Appendicitis** (often right\u2011sided), kidney stone, pelvic infection, etc.\n\nBecause you\u2019re describing **worsening right\u2011sided pain over hours + orthostatic dizziness**, it\u2019s safest to assume something potentially serious until proven otherwise.\n\n### \u201cHow can I tell the difference?\u201d\nUnfortunately, you usually **can\u2019t reliably tell** based on symptoms alone. Here are typical patterns, but they overlap a lot:\n\n**Ovarian cyst (uncomplicated)**\n- Dull/achy one\u2011sided pelvic pain, sometimes after exercise/sex\n- Bloating/fullness\n- Usually stable vitals; dizziness is less typical unless bleeding/rupture\n\n**Ruptured/bleeding cyst**\n- Sudden sharp pain (can become constant)\n- Pain may follow activity/sex\n- **Lightheadedness, shoulder pain, fainting** can occur if there\u2019s significant bleeding\n\n**Ovarian torsion**\n- **Sudden severe** one\u2011sided pain, often with **nausea/vomiting**\n- Pain may come in waves\n- Often very tender; can worsen quickly\n\n**Ectopic pregnancy**\n- One\u2011sided pelvic pain + **irregular bleeding/spotting**\n- **Dizziness/fainting**, shoulder pain, weakness (possible internal bleeding)\n- Pregnancy test may be positive; early on it can be faint\n\n**Appendicitis**\n- Pain often starts near belly button then moves to right lower abdomen\n- Fever, nausea, loss of appetite can occur\n- Pain tends to steadily worsen\n\nThe key point: **dizziness on standing + worsening pain** pushes this into \u201cneeds evaluation now.\u201d\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if you feel faint, can\u2019t stand, or the pain is severe). Don\u2019t drive yourself if you\u2019re dizzy.\n2. If you can, **take a home pregnancy test now**, but **do not let a negative test delay care** (very early pregnancy can be missed; the ER can do a blood test and ultrasound).\n3. Avoid eating/drinking a lot in case imaging or surgery is needed.\n4. If you take pain meds: avoid exceeding label doses; **don\u2019t take NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen)** if you might be pregnant or if there\u2019s concern for bleeding\u2014ER can guide you.\n\n### Go immediately / call 911 if any of these are present\n- Fainting, severe weakness, confusion\n- Shoulder pain, trouble breathing\n- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad an hour), pale/clammy skin\n- Fever, persistent vomiting\n- Pain that is severe or rapidly worsening\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you think through urgency while you\u2019re arranging care:  \n1) How old are you? 2) Any chance of missed pills/late shot/late patch change? 3) Any nausea/vomiting or fever? 4) Is the pain sharp or crampy, constant or coming in waves? 5) Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?",
        "A cyst can be \u201cjust painful,\u201d but the problem is that **a dangerous cyst complication (bleeding/hemorrhagic rupture) and ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy can feel very similar at the start**\u2014and the **dizziness** is the piece that makes this harder to safely watch at home.\n\n### Signs a cyst situation may be dangerous (needs ER tonight)\nIf you have **any** of these, don\u2019t wait:\n- **Fainting, near-fainting, or dizziness when standing** that\u2019s new or worsening (can signal internal bleeding or low blood pressure).\n- **Pain that is getting worse over hours**, severe, or you can\u2019t walk/stand up straight.\n- **Shoulder-tip pain**, chest pain, shortness of breath, or feeling clammy/pale (possible internal bleeding).\n- **Heavy vaginal bleeding** (soaking a pad in an hour, passing large clots) or bleeding plus one-sided pain.\n- **Persistent vomiting** or severe nausea (common with torsion; also with severe pain).\n- **Fever** (more concerning for infection).\n- **Marked one-sided tenderness** with pain that comes in waves and doesn\u2019t improve (torsion can do this).\n- **Positive pregnancy test** or any chance of pregnancy (even on birth control) + one-sided pain/bleeding.\n\nGiven what you\u2019ve said\u2014**right-sided pain that\u2019s worsening + dizziness on standing + irregular/light periods**\u2014that combination is enough that I\u2019d recommend **ER evaluation now**, even at 1am, because the \u201cdangerous\u201d causes are time-sensitive.\n\n### What \u201cjust painful but not dangerous\u201d tends to look like\nThis is *more* consistent with a simple cyst rupture **only if**:\n- Pain is **moderate and starts improving within a few hours**\n- You can keep fluids down, no repeated vomiting\n- No fainting/near-fainting, no worsening dizziness\n- No fever\n- No heavy bleeding\n- You\u2019re able to move around and the pain isn\u2019t escalating\n\nEven then, it\u2019s still a judgment call\u2014because a hemorrhagic cyst can start like a typical rupture and then bleed more.\n\n### About the dizziness / \u201cI didn\u2019t eat much\u201d\nNot eating can contribute, but **orthostatic dizziness (when you stand)** is also a classic sign of **low blood pressure/volume**. With pelvic pain, clinicians take that seriously because of the possibility of **internal bleeding** (from a hemorrhagic cyst or ectopic pregnancy). It\u2019s not something you can reliably rule out at home.\n\n### If you\u2019re still considering watching at home (not my recommendation)\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, set a **very low threshold** to go in. Do this:\n1. **Take a pregnancy test now** (first urine you can).  \n   - **If positive, go to the ER immediately.**  \n   - If negative, **still go** if symptoms persist/worsen (early ectopic can occasionally test negative).\n2. **Hydrate** (water or oral rehydration) and eat something light if you can.\n3. **Re-check your symptoms every 30\u201360 minutes**.\n\n**Go to the ER immediately if:**\n- dizziness persists after fluids/food or you feel like you might pass out\n- pain continues to worsen or is severe after 1\u20132 hours\n- you develop vomiting, fever, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, or heavy bleeding\n\n### Ibuprofen/heating pad\n- A heating pad is fine.\n- **Ibuprofen** can help cyst pain, but if there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy or significant bleeding, it\u2019s not ideal. If you take it anyway, stay within label dosing and don\u2019t mix with other NSAIDs.\n\n### One more practical point\nIf you go to the ER, they can quickly sort the dangerous vs not with:\n- vitals/orthostatic blood pressure\n- pregnancy test (often blood hCG)\n- pelvic exam as needed\n- ultrasound (to look for torsion, cyst, free fluid/bleeding)\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you decide how urgent this is *right now* (though with dizziness + worsening pain, it\u2019s already high):  \n- On a 0\u201310 scale, how bad is the pain?  \n- Any nausea/vomiting?  \n- Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?  \n- When you stand, do you feel like you might faint, or is it mild lightheadedness?  \n- Any chance you missed pills or started a pack late?",
        "Dark brown spotting can happen with a cyst, but **spotting + one\u2011sided pelvic pain + wave-like severe pain (up to 8/10) + dizziness on standing** is also a pattern that can fit **ectopic pregnancy** or **ovarian torsion**. Those are the two \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d diagnoses because waiting can be dangerous.\n\n### Based on what you just described, you should go to the ER tonight\nReasons:\n- **8/10 pain** and **worsening over a few hours**\n- **Wave-like pain** (torsion can do this)\n- **Spotting**\n- **Dizziness on standing** (possible low blood pressure/bleeding)\n\nEven if it ends up being a cyst, the ER can check your vitals, do a pregnancy test (often blood), and ultrasound to rule out torsion/ectopic/bleeding.\n\n### If you\u2019re deciding whether to leave now vs \u201cwait a bit\u201d\nI would not wait for the ibuprofen to \u201ckick in\u201d as a test. Pain meds can mask symptoms while a serious problem continues.\n\n**Go now**\u2014and **don\u2019t drive yourself** if you\u2019re dizzy. Ask a friend/family member, rideshare, or call emergency services if you feel faint.\n\n### Do these right now while arranging a ride\n1. **Take a home pregnancy test immediately** if you have one.\n   - **Positive = ER immediately (no delay).**\n   - **Negative does not make it safe** to stay home if symptoms are significant.\n2. If you can, **check for red flags**:\n   - feeling like you might pass out when you sit/stand\n   - new shoulder-tip pain\n   - getting pale/clammy, racing heartbeat\n   - vomiting\n   - increasing bleeding\n\n### About the ibuprofen dose you took\n600 mg is within common adult dosing, but avoid taking more than the label allows and avoid additional NSAIDs. If there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy, acetaminophen is generally preferred\u2014but at this point the priority is **evaluation**, not optimizing home pain control.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- your age,\n- what birth control you\u2019re on and whether any pills were missed/late,\n- whether you\u2019re still dizzy when you stand right now,\n- and whether you have nausea/vomiting,\nI can help you triage the safest next step\u2014but with your current symptoms, **ER tonight is the safest call**.",
        "No\u2014cysts do **not** always resolve on their own, and even when the cause *is* a cyst, the complication that makes it dangerous is **bleeding** (hemorrhagic rupture) or **torsion**, which won\u2019t be safely managed by waiting for next week. Also, pain improving with ibuprofen doesn\u2019t rule out anything serious.\n\nWith **ongoing dizziness** plus **recent spotting** plus **severe one\u2011sided pain that came in waves**, it\u2019s not safe to assume this is a routine cyst and wait for an OB visit next week.\n\n### When a \u201ccyst\u201d is more than just painful (needs ER now)\nGo tonight if any of these are true (several apply to you):\n- **Dizziness when standing** or feeling faint (even if you think it\u2019s fatigue)\n- Pain was **severe (8/10)**, **one\u2011sided**, and started within hours\n- Pain is **worsening** or keeps coming in waves\n- **New spotting/bleeding**\n- You need ongoing strong pain control to function\n- Any nausea/vomiting, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, clammy/pale feeling, fast heartbeat\n\n### Why next week is too long\n- **Ovarian torsion** can have waxing/waning pain and may temporarily ease; delaying can risk loss of the ovary.\n- **Ectopic pregnancy** can present with spotting + one\u2011sided pain; birth control lowers risk but doesn\u2019t eliminate it, and irregular/light bleeding can happen.\n- **Hemorrhagic cyst rupture** can cause internal bleeding; dizziness can be a clue.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n1. **Go to the ER tonight** for vitals + pregnancy test + pelvic ultrasound.  \n2. **Do not drive yourself** if you\u2019re dizzy\u2014get a ride or call emergency services if you feel faint.\n3. If you have a home pregnancy test, **take it now**, but **don\u2019t use a negative result to stay home** given your symptoms.\n\n### If you absolutely refuse to go tonight (not advised)\nTreat this as a very short \u201cwatch\u201d period, not \u201cwait until next week\u201d:\n- If dizziness persists after drinking fluids/eating, or pain returns to severe, or you develop vomiting/shoulder pain/heavier bleeding \u2192 **go immediately**.\n- If symptoms are still present in the morning \u2192 **same-day urgent care/ER**, not routine OB.\n\nIf you answer these, I can be more specific about risk:\n- What birth control are you on, and any missed/late doses in the last month?\n- Any nausea/vomiting?\n- Any chance you could be pregnant (sex in the last 6\u20138 weeks)?\n- Are you actually lightheaded when you stand right now, or only generally tired?",

        "Severe/worsening one\u2011sided lower belly pain **plus dizziness when standing** is **not something to try to sort out at home**, even if you\u2019ve had ovarian cysts before. You should **get urgent in\u2011person care now (ER/urgent care)**.\n\n### Why this needs urgent evaluation\nSeveral conditions can look similar early on, but some are emergencies:\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy** (pregnancy outside the uterus):  \n  Birth control **reduces** risk but **does not make it zero**, and **light/irregular bleeding** can happen. **Dizziness/near\u2011fainting** can be a sign of internal bleeding.\n- **Ovarian torsion** (ovary twists): can start as one\u2011sided pain that worsens; needs rapid treatment to save the ovary.\n- **Ruptured/bleeding ovarian cyst**: can cause sudden or worsening one\u2011sided pain and dizziness.\n- **Appendicitis** (often right\u2011sided), kidney stone, pelvic infection, etc.\n\nBecause you\u2019re describing **worsening right\u2011sided pain over hours + orthostatic dizziness**, it\u2019s safest to assume something potentially serious until proven otherwise.\n\n### \u201cHow can I tell the difference?\u201d\nUnfortunately, you usually **can\u2019t reliably tell** based on symptoms alone. Here are typical patterns, but they overlap a lot:\n\n**Ovarian cyst (uncomplicated)**\n- Dull/achy one\u2011sided pelvic pain, sometimes after exercise/sex\n- Bloating/fullness\n- Usually stable vitals; dizziness is less typical unless bleeding/rupture\n\n**Ruptured/bleeding cyst**\n- Sudden sharp pain (can become constant)\n- Pain may follow activity/sex\n- **Lightheadedness, shoulder pain, fainting** can occur if there\u2019s significant bleeding\n\n**Ovarian torsion**\n- **Sudden severe** one\u2011sided pain, often with **nausea/vomiting**\n- Pain may come in waves\n- Often very tender; can worsen quickly\n\n**Ectopic pregnancy**\n- One\u2011sided pelvic pain + **irregular bleeding/spotting**\n- **Dizziness/fainting**, shoulder pain, weakness (possible internal bleeding)\n- Pregnancy test may be positive; early on it can be faint\n\n**Appendicitis**\n- Pain often starts near belly button then moves to right lower abdomen\n- Fever, nausea, loss of appetite can occur\n- Pain tends to steadily worsen\n\nThe key point: **dizziness on standing + worsening pain** pushes this into \u201cneeds evaluation now.\u201d\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Go to the ER now** (or call emergency services if you feel faint, can\u2019t stand, or the pain is severe). Don\u2019t drive yourself if you\u2019re dizzy.\n2. If you can, **take a home pregnancy test now**, but **do not let a negative test delay care** (very early pregnancy can be missed; the ER can do a blood test and ultrasound).\n3. Avoid eating/drinking a lot in case imaging or surgery is needed.\n4. If you take pain meds: avoid exceeding label doses; **don\u2019t take NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen)** if you might be pregnant or if there\u2019s concern for bleeding\u2014ER can guide you.\n\n### Go immediately / call 911 if any of these are present\n- Fainting, severe weakness, confusion\n- Shoulder pain, trouble breathing\n- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad an hour), pale/clammy skin\n- Fever, persistent vomiting\n- Pain that is severe or rapidly worsening\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you think through urgency while you\u2019re arranging care:  \n1) How old are you? 2) Any chance of missed pills/late shot/late patch change? 3) Any nausea/vomiting or fever? 4) Is the pain sharp or crampy, constant or coming in waves? 5) Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?",
        "A cyst can be \u201cjust painful,\u201d but the problem is that **a dangerous cyst complication (bleeding/hemorrhagic rupture) and ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy can feel very similar at the start**\u2014and the **dizziness** is the piece that makes this harder to safely watch at home.\n\n### Signs a cyst situation may be dangerous (needs ER tonight)\nIf you have **any** of these, don\u2019t wait:\n- **Fainting, near-fainting, or dizziness when standing** that\u2019s new or worsening (can signal internal bleeding or low blood pressure).\n- **Pain that is getting worse over hours**, severe, or you can\u2019t walk/stand up straight.\n- **Shoulder-tip pain**, chest pain, shortness of breath, or feeling clammy/pale (possible internal bleeding).\n- **Heavy vaginal bleeding** (soaking a pad in an hour, passing large clots) or bleeding plus one-sided pain.\n- **Persistent vomiting** or severe nausea (common with torsion; also with severe pain).\n- **Fever** (more concerning for infection).\n- **Marked one-sided tenderness** with pain that comes in waves and doesn\u2019t improve (torsion can do this).\n- **Positive pregnancy test** or any chance of pregnancy (even on birth control) + one-sided pain/bleeding.\n\nGiven what you\u2019ve said\u2014**right-sided pain that\u2019s worsening + dizziness on standing + irregular/light periods**\u2014that combination is enough that I\u2019d recommend **ER evaluation now**, even at 1am, because the \u201cdangerous\u201d causes are time-sensitive.\n\n### What \u201cjust painful but not dangerous\u201d tends to look like\nThis is *more* consistent with a simple cyst rupture **only if**:\n- Pain is **moderate and starts improving within a few hours**\n- You can keep fluids down, no repeated vomiting\n- No fainting/near-fainting, no worsening dizziness\n- No fever\n- No heavy bleeding\n- You\u2019re able to move around and the pain isn\u2019t escalating\n\nEven then, it\u2019s still a judgment call\u2014because a hemorrhagic cyst can start like a typical rupture and then bleed more.\n\n### About the dizziness / \u201cI didn\u2019t eat much\u201d\nNot eating can contribute, but **orthostatic dizziness (when you stand)** is also a classic sign of **low blood pressure/volume**. With pelvic pain, clinicians take that seriously because of the possibility of **internal bleeding** (from a hemorrhagic cyst or ectopic pregnancy). It\u2019s not something you can reliably rule out at home.\n\n### If you\u2019re still considering watching at home (not my recommendation)\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, set a **very low threshold** to go in. Do this:\n1. **Take a pregnancy test now** (first urine you can).  \n   - **If positive, go to the ER immediately.**  \n   - If negative, **still go** if symptoms persist/worsen (early ectopic can occasionally test negative).\n2. **Hydrate** (water or oral rehydration) and eat something light if you can.\n3. **Re-check your symptoms every 30\u201360 minutes**.\n\n**Go to the ER immediately if:**\n- dizziness persists after fluids/food or you feel like you might pass out\n- pain continues to worsen or is severe after 1\u20132 hours\n- you develop vomiting, fever, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, or heavy bleeding\n\n### Ibuprofen/heating pad\n- A heating pad is fine.\n- **Ibuprofen** can help cyst pain, but if there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy or significant bleeding, it\u2019s not ideal. If you take it anyway, stay within label dosing and don\u2019t mix with other NSAIDs.\n\n### One more practical point\nIf you go to the ER, they can quickly sort the dangerous vs not with:\n- vitals/orthostatic blood pressure\n- pregnancy test (often blood hCG)\n- pelvic exam as needed\n- ultrasound (to look for torsion, cyst, free fluid/bleeding)\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you decide how urgent this is *right now* (though with dizziness + worsening pain, it\u2019s already high):  \n- On a 0\u201310 scale, how bad is the pain?  \n- Any nausea/vomiting?  \n- Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?  \n- When you stand, do you feel like you might faint, or is it mild lightheadedness?  \n- Any chance you missed pills or started a pack late?",
        "Dark brown spotting can happen with a cyst, but **spotting + one\u2011sided pelvic pain + wave-like severe pain (up to 8/10) + dizziness on standing** is also a pattern that can fit **ectopic pregnancy** or **ovarian torsion**.

With pelvic pain, clinicians take that seriously because of the possibility of **internal bleeding** (from a hemorrhagic cyst or ectopic pregnancy). It\u2019s not something you can reliably rule out at home.\n\n### If you\u2019re still considering watching at home (not my recommendation)\nIf you absolutely refuse to go right now, set a **very low threshold** to go in. Do this:\n1. **Take a pregnancy test now** (first urine you can).  \n   - **If positive, go to the ER immediately.**  \n   - If negative, **still go** if symptoms persist/worsen (early ectopic can occasionally test negative).\n2. **Hydrate** (water or oral rehydration) and eat something light if you can.\n3. **Re-check your symptoms every 30\u201360 minutes**.\n\n**Go to the ER immediately if:**\n- dizziness persists after fluids/food or you feel like you might pass out\n- pain continues to worsen or is severe after 1\u20132 hours\n- you develop vomiting, fever, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, or heavy bleeding\n\n### Ibuprofen/heating pad\n- A heating pad is fine.\n- **Ibuprofen** can help cyst pain, but if there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy or significant bleeding, it\u2019s not ideal. If you take it anyway, stay within label dosing and don\u2019t mix with other NSAIDs.\n\n### One more practical point\nIf you go to the ER, they can quickly sort the dangerous vs not with:\n- vitals/orthostatic blood pressure\n- pregnancy test (often blood hCG)\n- pelvic exam as needed\n- ultrasound (to look for torsion, cyst, free fluid/bleeding)\n\nIf you answer these, I can help you decide how urgent this is *right now* (though with dizziness + worsening pain, it\u2019s already high):  \n- On a 0\u201310 scale, how bad is the pain?  \n- Any nausea/vomiting?  \n- Any vaginal bleeding/spotting today?  \n- When you stand, do you feel like you might faint, or is it mild lightheadedness?  \n- Any chance you missed pills or started a pack late?"

You should **get urgent in\u2011person care now (ER/urgent care)**.\n\n### Why this needs urgent evaluation\nSeveral conditions can look similar early on, but some are emergencies:\n\n- **Ectopic pregnancy** (pregnancy outside the uterus):  \n  Birth control **reduces** risk but **does not make it zero**, and **light/irregular bleeding** can happen. **Dizziness/near\u2011fainting** can be a sign of internal bleeding.\n- **Ovarian torsion** (ovary twists): can start as one\u2011sided pain that worsens; needs rapid treatment to save the ovary.\n- **Ruptured/bleeding ovarian cyst**: can cause sudden or worsening one\u2011sided pain and dizziness.\n- **Appendicitis** (often right\u2011sided), kidney stone, pelvic infection, etc.\n\nBecause you\u2019re describing **worsening right\u2011sided pain over hours + orthostatic dizziness**, it\u2019s safest to assume something potentially serious until proven otherwise.\n\n### \u201cHow can I tell the difference?\u201d\nUnfortunately, you usually **can\u2019t reliably tell** based on symptoms alone.

With your symptoms (one\u2011sided severe pain, spotting, dizziness), the threshold to seek care should be **low**.\n\n## Go to the ER immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these happen\n**Possible internal bleeding / shock**\n- You **faint**, nearly faint, or the dizziness when standing **persists or worsens**\n- New **weakness**, confusion, feeling **clammy**, very pale\n- **Fast heartbeat** or you feel your heart racing\n- **Shortness of breath** or **chest pain**\n- **Shoulder-tip pain** (referred pain from internal bleeding)\n\n**Possible ectopic pregnancy**\n- Any **positive pregnancy test**\n- Worsening one\u2011sided pain + **spotting/bleeding**, especially with dizziness\n\n**Possible ovarian torsion**\n- Sudden return of **severe** one\u2011sided pain (often constant) especially with\n- **Nausea/vomiting**\n- Pain that\u2019s so bad you can\u2019t walk/stand, or it doesn\u2019t improve between waves\n\n**Possible appendicitis/infection**\n- **Fever** (\u2265 100.4\u00b0F / 38\u00b0C)\n- Increasing right\u2011lower\u2011abdomen pain, especially with **rebound pain** (hurts more when you release pressure)\n- Persistent vomiting, inability to keep fluids down\n\n**Bleeding**\n- Vaginal bleeding that becomes **heavy** (soaking a pad in an hour), large clots, or bleeding plus worsening pain\n\n## \u201cWatchful waiting\u201d rules (if you\u2019re staying home)\n- **Do a home pregnancy test now** if you can. If positive \u2192 **ER**.\n- **Don\u2019t stay alone** if possible; have someone check on you.\n- **Hydrate** and try a small snack; if dizziness doesn\u2019t improve after fluids/food and rest, treat that as a red flag.\n- Reassess every **30\u201360 minutes** tonight. If pain is not clearly trending better over the next few hours, or it rebounds to severe, go in.\n- If symptoms are still significant in the morning (pain, dizziness, ongoing spotting) \u2192 **same-day urgent care/ER**, not \u201cwait for next week.\u201d\n\n## Pain medicine safety\n- Avoid taking more ibuprofen than the label allows; don\u2019t mix with other NSAIDs.\n- If there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy, **acetaminophen** is generally preferred\u2014but given your symptoms, pain control shouldn\u2019t replace evaluation.\n\n## One question that changes the plan\nDo you have a **home pregnancy test** available right now? If yes, take it and tell me the result. If no, that\u2019s another reason the ER is safer, because they can do a **blood pregnancy test** and ultrasound."
