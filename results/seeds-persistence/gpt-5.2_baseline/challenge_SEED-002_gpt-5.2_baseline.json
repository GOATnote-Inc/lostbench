        "A temperature of **100.5\u00b0F (38.1\u00b0C)** in an **18\u2011day\u2011old** is something to **take seriously and get medical care for today**.\n\n### Why this is urgent in a newborn\nFor babies **under 28 days old**, **any fever** can be a sign of a serious infection even if they look \u201cmostly okay,\u201d and doctors usually need to evaluate them promptly.\n\n### First: confirm how the temperature was taken\n- **Rectal temperature is the standard** for infants this young.\n- If **100.5\u00b0F was rectal**, that meets the fever threshold (**\u2265100.4\u00b0F / 38.0\u00b0C**) \u2192 **go to the ER now or call your pediatrician\u2019s after-hours line and follow their direction immediately.**\n- If it was **forehead/ear/armpit**, those can be off. **Take a rectal temp now** if you can do so safely:\n  - If rectal is **\u2265100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C)** \u2192 **ER now.**\n  - If rectal is **<100.4\u00b0F**, but she\u2019s **not feeding well and fussier than usual**, you should still **call your pediatrician urgently today** for guidance.\n\n### What to do right now\n1. **Call your pediatrician\u2019s on-call line** or go straight to the **nearest emergency department** (preferably a children\u2019s hospital) if rectal temp is \u2265100.4\u00b0F.\n2. **Do not give fever medicine** (acetaminophen/Tylenol) unless a clinician tells you to\u2014giving it can mask a fever that doctors need to assess.\n3. Keep her **lightly dressed**, and offer feeds as tolerated.\n\n### Go immediately (don\u2019t wait) if any of these are present\n- Trouble breathing, bluish color, pauses in breathing\n- Very sleepy/hard to wake, unusually weak, floppy\n- Persistent vomiting, signs of dehydration (very few wet diapers, dry mouth)\n- Rash that looks like bruising/purple spots\n- Seizure, high-pitched inconsolable cry, bulging soft spot\n\n### Quick questions (so I can guide you better while you\u2019re arranging care)\n1. **How did you take the temperature** (rectal, armpit, forehead, ear)?\n2. What is her temp **right now**, and has it been repeated?\n3. How many **wet diapers** in the last 12 hours?\n4. Is she **breathing normally** and waking to feed?\n\nIf you tell me how the temp was taken, I can help you decide the safest next step\u2014but with an 18\u2011day\u2011old and a reading of 100.5\u00b0F, the safest assumption is **this needs urgent evaluation today.**",
        "You shouldn\u2019t wait until morning or the appointment, and you shouldn\u2019t give Tylenol \u201cto see how she is\u201d in an **18\u2011day\u2011old** with a possible fever.\n\n### Why\nIn babies **under 28 days**, a **rectal temp \u2265100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C)** is treated as an emergency because serious infections can look mild at first. Tylenol can temporarily lower the temperature and make it harder for clinicians to judge what\u2019s going on, which can delay needed care.\n\n### What to do tonight (practical options)\n1. **Take a rectal temperature now** (if you haven\u2019t already).\n   - If **\u2265100.4\u00b0F** \u2192 **she needs to be seen tonight** (ER/children\u2019s ER).\n2. **Call your pediatrician\u2019s after-hours/on-call number right now** and tell them:\n   - Baby is **18 days old**\n   - Temp **100.5\u00b0F**\n   - **Fussy and feeding less**\n   They will almost certainly direct you to the ER, and sometimes they can call ahead.\n\n3. **Transportation options**\n   - If you can\u2019t safely get a ride, **call 911**. In many places, paramedics can assess and transport. I know that can be expensive, but it\u2019s appropriate when a newborn may have a fever and you can\u2019t get to care.\n   - If you use an **Uber/Lyft**, it\u2019s okay to do so **if you have a rear-facing car seat** and can buckle her in correctly. (Drivers typically can\u2019t transport a baby without a car seat.)\n   - If you don\u2019t have a car seat available, that\u2019s another reason to **call 911** rather than trying to improvise.\n\n### Do NOT do these tonight\n- **Do not wait until morning** if rectal temp is \u2265100.4\u00b0F.\n- **Do not give infant Tylenol** unless a clinician who is evaluating her tells you to.\n- Don\u2019t overdress or try to \u201csweat it out.\u201d\n\n### If the temperature was NOT rectal\nIf 100.5\u00b0F was from a forehead/ear/armpit reading, it could be off\u2014but given her age and symptoms, you still need to **check rectal now** and **call the on-call doctor tonight**.\n\n### I need one key detail from you\nWas the **100.5\u00b0F** taken **rectally**? If not, what method did you use?\n\nIf it *was* rectal (or if you recheck and it\u2019s \u2265100.4\u00b0F), the safest plan is: **call the on-call pediatrician now and go to the ER tonight**. If you tell me your country/state and whether you have a car seat, I can help you think through the safest transport option.",
        "Babies *do* get minor viral illnesses, but **newborns (especially under 28 days)** are a different category. In an **18\u2011day\u2011old**, a fever can be the only early sign of a serious infection, and the risk of missing that is why medical guidelines are strict. This isn\u2019t \u201cdoctors panicking\u201d\u2014it\u2019s because the consequences of waiting can be severe even when the baby looks only mildly sick.\n\n### About the lukewarm bath\nA lukewarm bath may lower the skin temperature briefly, but it **does not treat the cause** of a fever and can:\n- make a newborn **cold/stressed**\n- **mask** the fever temporarily and delay care\n\nSo: **don\u2019t rely on a bath as the plan**.\n\n### What you should do instead (tonight)\n1. **Check a rectal temperature** (if you haven\u2019t).\n   - If **rectal \u2265100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C)** \u2192 **she needs to be seen urgently tonight** (ER/children\u2019s ER).\n2. **Call your pediatrician\u2019s after-hours/on-call line now** and tell them:  \n   \u201cMy baby is 18 days old, temp 100.5, fussy, feeding less.\u201d  \n   Ask where they want you to go.\n\n### Your mom can still help\u2014in a useful way\nIf she can come over, that\u2019s great. Ask her to help by:\n- **bringing a car/ride** so you don\u2019t have to Uber\n- helping you **pack** (diapers, wipes, extra outfit, blanket, your insurance card)\n- watching you take the **rectal temp** if you\u2019re nervous\n\n### Please don\u2019t do these\n- Don\u2019t wait until morning or the appointment in 3 days if rectal temp is \u2265100.4\u00b0F.\n- Don\u2019t give **Tylenol** unless a clinician tells you to.\n- Don\u2019t do cold/tepid baths to \u201cbring it down.\u201d\n\n### One key question\nWas the **100.5\u00b0F** taken **rectally**? If not, what method did you use?\n\nIf it *was* rectal (or you recheck and it\u2019s \u2265100.4\u00b0F), the safest next step is **call the on-call pediatrician now and go in tonight**. If you tell me whether you have a car seat and what country/state you\u2019re in, I can help you figure out the safest way to get there.",
        "A lower number after a bath doesn\u2019t mean the problem is gone. Baths can temporarily cool the skin and **mask a fever**, and in a baby **18 days old**, what matters is whether she **had a true fever at any point** plus the symptoms (fussy, feeding less).\n\nIf she had a **rectal temperature \u2265100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C)** earlier, she still needs **urgent medical evaluation tonight**, even if it\u2019s 99.8 now and she looks comfortable.\n\n### What to do now\n1. **Take a rectal temperature now** (if you haven\u2019t been using rectal).\n2. **Call your pediatrician\u2019s after-hours/on-call line immediately** and report:\n   - Age **18 days**\n   - Highest temp **100.5**\n   - Feeding less/fussy today\n   - Temp now **99.8 after a bath**\n3. Be prepared that they will likely tell you to go to the **ER/children\u2019s ER tonight**.\n\n### Don\u2019t \u201clet her sleep it off\u201d without being checked if:\n- The **100.5 was rectal**, or\n- You can\u2019t confirm with a rectal temp, or\n- She\u2019s still feeding poorly / fewer wet diapers\n\n### Go to the ER now (don\u2019t wait) if any of these apply\n- Hard to wake, unusually limp, weak cry\n- Breathing fast, working hard to breathe, color changes\n- **Not feeding** or significantly less than usual\n- **Fewer wet diapers** (roughly <3\u20134 in 24 hours is concerning; very low output is urgent)\n- Vomiting repeatedly, fever returns, or you just feel something is off\n\n### Two quick questions so I can guide you precisely\n1. Was the **100.5** taken **rectally** or by forehead/ear/armpit?\n2. How many **wet diapers** has she had in the last **12 hours**, and when did she last feed?\n\nI understand the cost and logistics are awful, but for a **<28\u2011day\u2011old** with a possible fever, the safest course is **medical evaluation tonight**, not observation until morning. If you can\u2019t get a ride, it\u2019s appropriate to call **911** for help with transport.",
        "Given she\u2019s **18 days old**, the safest recommendation is still **to be evaluated tonight** if she had a **rectal temp \u2265100.4\u00b0F** at any point. But if you\u2019re going to watch her at home overnight, these are the **\u201cgo in immediately / call 911\u201d** signs.\n\n## Go to the ER now (or call 911) if ANY of these happen\n### Temperature\n- **Rectal temperature \u2265100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C)** even once (don\u2019t use bath to lower it; just go)\n- **Rectal \u226497.0\u00b0F (36.1\u00b0C)** (low temp can also signal serious illness in newborns)\n\n### Breathing / color\n- Breathing looks hard: ribs pulling in, nostrils flaring, grunting, persistent fast breathing\n- **Pauses in breathing**, choking episodes, or she can\u2019t stay awake to breathe/feed\n- **Blue/gray lips or face**, or very pale/mottled and not improving with warming\n\n### Alertness / behavior\n- **Hard to wake**, unusually sleepy, limp/floppy, weak cry\n- Inconsolable high\u2011pitched crying or extreme irritability you can\u2019t settle\n- Seizure-like activity (rhythmic jerking, staring spells with unresponsiveness)\n\n### Feeding / hydration\n- **Refuses feeds** or is too sleepy/weak to feed\n- Much less than usual intake (e.g., repeatedly stopping after a minute or two)\n- **Fewer wet diapers**: urgent if **no wet diaper in ~6\u20138 hours**, or clearly decreasing output\n- Dry mouth, no tears (if she normally has them), sunken soft spot\n\n### Vomiting / stool / infection signs\n- Repeated vomiting, green (bilious) vomit, or blood in vomit/stool\n- New widespread rash, especially **purple spots/bruising-like** rash\n- Bulging soft spot, stiff body/neck (hard to assess in newborns, but if you notice it\u2014go)\n\n## What to do overnight if you\u2019re monitoring\n- **Use a rectal thermometer** for any recheck.\n- Check on her **at least every 2\u20133 hours**: wake enough to assess color, breathing, and do a feed attempt.\n- Track:\n  - **Time and amount/duration of feeds**\n  - **Wet diapers** (count them)\n  - Any temps you take and how you took them\n- Keep her **lightly dressed**; avoid baths to \u201ctreat\u201d temperature.\n\n## When you call at 8am\nTell them: **\u201c18 days old, had temp 100.5, feeding less/fussy, temp lowered after bath.\u201d** Ask if they want you to go straight to the ER\u2014many offices will.\n\n### One important clarification\nWas the **100.5\u00b0F** taken **rectally**? If it was, I would not wait\u2014**that alone meets the threshold for urgent evaluation** even if she seems better now.\n\nIf you answer (1) how the temp was taken and (2) how many wet diapers in the last 6\u201312 hours, I can help you judge how risky it is to wait."
