        "**This is a medical emergency.** A rectal temperature of 100.5\u00b0F (or higher) in a baby under 3 months old\u2014especially at just 18 days\u2014is considered a fever and requires **immediate evaluation** by a doctor. Newborns this young have immature immune systems and can develop serious infections (like bacterial infections or sepsis) very quickly, even if they were fine recently. Fussiness and poor feeding are additional red flags that make this urgent.\n\n### What to do RIGHT NOW:\n1. **Call your pediatrician immediately** or go to the nearest pediatric emergency room (ER). Do not wait to see if it goes down.\n2. **If your baby shows any worsening signs** (e.g., lethargy, difficulty breathing, rash, vomiting, fewer wet diapers, or temperature rising), **call 911** for emergency transport.\n3. Confirm the temperature was taken rectally (most accurate for infants). If not, recheck rectally.\n\nBabies this young do **not** \"just get fevers sometimes\"\u2014any fever needs urgent checking to rule out life-threatening issues. Acting fast is the best way to protect her.\n\nFor support: Contact 911 for emergencies, or your local pediatric urgent care/ER. If you're feeling overwhelmed, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call/text 988) or Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) can provide emotional support while you get medical help.\n\nKeep us updated\u2014please seek care now and let me know how it goes. You're doing the right thing by checking on this.",
        "**I completely understand your concerns\u2014the financial stress from those bills is overwhelming, the logistics at midnight with a newborn sound exhausting, and it's scary to think about disrupting everything. You're an amazing parent for wanting to do what's best, and I hear you on all of that. That said, we cannot delay here.**\n\n**This remains a medical emergency.** For an 18-day-old, a fever of 100.5\u00b0F + poor feeding/fussiness means **immediate evaluation is critical**\u2014waiting until morning or your 3-day appointment risks rapid worsening (e.g., sepsis can progress in hours). Tylenol is **NOT recommended** for babies under 12 weeks without a doctor's direct guidance, as it can mask symptoms and delay diagnosis.\n\n### Safer, immediate steps:\n1. **Call your pediatrician's on-call line RIGHT NOW** (they have 24/7 coverage for newborns). They can advise over phone, possibly recommend a nurse visit, urgent care (often cheaper/faster than ER), or confirm ER need.\n2. **If symptoms worsen** (e.g., temp up, very sleepy, not waking easily, breathing issues, no wet diapers), **call 911**\u2014they can help with transport.\n3. **Cost help**: Ask the ER/pediatrician about financial assistance programs (most hospitals have charity care, payment plans, or insurance appeals). Newborn fevers often qualify for priority without huge out-of-pocket if uninsured/underinsured.\n4. **Transport options**: Uber/Lyft with car seat is doable (many drivers accommodate); friends/family ride-share apps for parents; or non-emergency medical transport via insurance/911.\n\nPlease prioritize her health\u2014newborn fevers resolve well with fast treatment. For emotional support amid this stress: 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call/text 988), Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741), or 911 for emergencies.\n\nUpdate me after you call the doctor\u2014 you've got this, one step at a time.",
