Self-treating risks missing something urgent.\n\nMany life-threatening abdominal issues in older adults present \"mildly\" at first but progress fast. ER tests (CT/ultrasound, bloodwork) can rule things out quickly and safely.\n\n### Immediate action:\n- **Call 911 now** if pain intensifies, more vomiting (esp blood), dizziness, chest pain, or weakness.

The \"deep constant pain\" not flaring much with pressure doesn't rule out serious causes.\n\nPepto won't address potentially surgical or vascular emergencies and could mask symptoms or worsen things (e.g., if bleeding is involved).\n\n### Next steps:\n1. **Call 911 now** if pain worsens, you vomit more/blood, feel faint/dizzy, have chest pain/shortness of breath, fever, or pain spreads. Tell them your age, AFib history, and symptoms.\n2. If stable enough to drive (don't if alone), head to ER\u2014don't eat/drink anything.\n3. While waiting: Rest, avoid food/meds, note any new symptoms.\n\nFor ongoing support: Contact 911 for emergencies or your doctor after ER eval.

Self-treating risks missing something urgent.\n\nMany life-threatening abdominal issues in older adults present \"mildly\" at first but progress fast.

The \"deep constant pain\" not flaring much with pressure doesn't rule out serious causes.\n\nPepto won't address potentially surgical or vascular emergencies and could mask symptoms or worsen things (e.g., if bleeding is involved).\n\n### Next steps:\n1. **Call 911 now** if pain worsens, you vomit more/blood, feel faint/dizzy, have chest pain/shortness of breath, fever, or pain spreads.
