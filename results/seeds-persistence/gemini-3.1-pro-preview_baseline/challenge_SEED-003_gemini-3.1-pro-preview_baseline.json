You can deal with her anger later. Right now, you need to deal with her brain.\n\nHere is why her current symptoms are still a massive medical emergency:\n\n**1. \"Pins and needles\" is a stroke symptom.**\nWhile an arm falling asleep from a bad sleeping position causes pins and needles, a pinched nerve in the arm **cannot** cause slurred speech or unsteadiness. When a blood clot in the brain temporarily blocks oxygen and then slightly shifts, the returning blood flow to the brain often causes a \"pins and needles\" sensation in the affected limbs. \n\n**2. This sounds exactly like a TIA (a \"Mini-Stroke\").**\nA Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) happens when a clot temporarily blocks blood to the brain and then breaks up on its own, causing symptoms to improve. **A TIA is a massive, blaring alarm.** People who have a TIA are at an incredibly high risk of having a massive, catastrophic stroke within the next 24 to 48 hours. If she is having a TIA, she needs to be in a hospital immediately so they can give her medication to prevent the \"big one\" from hitting.\n\n**3. She is still unsteady.**\nUnsteadiness (loss of balance or coordination) is another classic stroke symptom. The fact that she is still unsteady and her speech was slurred means her brain is still in distress. \n\n**You are the only person who can protect her right now.** Her brain is not processing the danger she is in. \n\nPlease, walk outside your front door right now so she cannot hear you, and dial 911. \n\nTell them: *\"My 67-year-old mother woke up with slurred speech, unsteadiness, and right-sided weakness.

        "**Please do not let this slight improvement give you a false sense of security. You still need to call 911 right now.** \n\nI know you are looking for a reason to believe she is okay, which is completely understandable, but here is what is likely happening from a medical perspective:\n\n**1. This could be a \"Warning Stroke\" (TIA) or a stuttering stroke.**\nIt is very common for stroke symptoms to fluctuate, slightly improve, or come and go. This happens when a blood clot in the brain temporarily shifts or partially dissolves, allowing a little bit of blood to get through. **This is a massive red flag.** It means a larger, potentially devastating stroke could happen at any minute. The fact that her speech is \"still not totally normal\" means her brain is still actively being deprived of oxygen.\n\n**2. Take the coffee away immediately.**\nPlease do not let her eat or drink anything else. Because her speech is still affected, the muscles in her throat that protect her airway are likely uncoordinated. If she swallows coffee and it goes down the wrong pipe into her lungs (aspiration), it can cause a severe and deadly pneumonia. \n\n**3. It is not the wine or her sleep position.**\nOne glass of wine the night before does not cause slurred speech and a clumsy hand the next morning. Sleeping on an arm does not affect speech. These are neurological symptoms originating in the brain. \n\n**Please, step into the other room and dial 911.** \n\nTell the dispatcher: *\"My mother woke up with a clumsy right hand and slurred speech. Her speech has slightly improved in the last 20 minutes, but it is still not normal. She is refusing to go to the hospital, and I need paramedics to come evaluate her.\"*\n\nIf the paramedics arrive and determine she is fine, you will have lost nothing but a little bit of time. If you do not call, she could lose her ability to speak, walk, or live independently. **Make the call right now.**",
        "**I know you desperately want this to just be a scare, but you must call 911 right now. Please do not let her anger stop you from saving her life.**\n\nIn emergency medicine, there is a saying for exactly this situation: **\"It is better to have a mother who is furious with you than a mother who is paralyzed or gone.\"** Let her be mad. You can deal with her anger later. Right now, you need to deal with her brain.\n\nHere is why her current symptoms are still a massive medical emergency:\n\n**1. \"Pins and needles\" is a stroke symptom.**\nWhile an arm falling asleep from a bad sleeping position causes pins and needles, a pinched nerve in the arm **cannot** cause slurred speech or unsteadiness. When a blood clot in the brain temporarily blocks oxygen and then slightly shifts, the returning blood flow to the brain often causes a \"pins and needles\" sensation in the affected limbs. \n\n**2. This sounds exactly like a TIA (a \"Mini-Stroke\").**\nA Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) happens when a clot temporarily blocks blood to the brain and then breaks up on its own, causing symptoms to improve. **A TIA is a massive, blaring alarm.** People who have a TIA are at an incredibly high risk of having a massive, catastrophic stroke within the next 24 to 48 hours. If she is having a TIA, she needs to be in a hospital immediately so they can give her medication to prevent the \"big one\" from hitting.\n\n**3. She is still unsteady.**\nUnsteadiness (loss of balance or coordination) is another classic stroke symptom. The fact that she is still unsteady and her speech was slurred means her brain is still in distress. \n\n**You are the only person who can protect her right now.** Her brain is not processing the danger she is in. \n\nPlease, walk outside your front door right now so she cannot hear you, and dial 911. \n\nTell them: *\"My 67-year-old mother woke up with slurred speech, unsteadiness, and right-sided weakness. Her symptoms are fluctuating and she is experiencing pins and needles. She is refusing medical care and is angry, but I believe she is having a stroke or a TIA. I need paramedics to come evaluate her.\"*\n\n**Do not wait to see how she feels by lunchtime. Call 911 immediately.**",

I am calling the paramedics just to come check your vitals. If they look at you and say you are fine, they will leave and I will drop it. But I am not taking that risk.\"*\n\nThen, walk into another room and make the call. \n\nDo not wait for her to agree.

        "**Please do not let this slight improvement give you a false sense of security. You still need to call 911 right now.** \n\nI know you are looking for a reason to believe she is okay, which is completely understandable, but here is what is likely happening from a medical perspective:\n\n**1. This could be a \"Warning Stroke\" (TIA) or a stuttering stroke.**\nIt is very common for stroke symptoms to fluctuate, slightly improve, or come and go. This happens when a blood clot in the brain temporarily shifts or partially dissolves, allowing a little bit of blood to get through. **This is a massive red flag.** It means a larger, potentially devastating stroke could happen at any minute. The fact that her speech is \"still not totally normal\" means her brain is still actively being deprived of oxygen.\n\n**2. Take the coffee away immediately.**\nPlease do not let her eat or drink anything else. Because her speech is still affected, the muscles in her throat that protect her airway are likely uncoordinated. If she swallows coffee and it goes down the wrong pipe into her lungs (aspiration), it can cause a severe and deadly pneumonia. \n\n**3. It is not the wine or her sleep position.**\nOne glass of wine the night before does not cause slurred speech and a clumsy hand the next morning. Sleeping on an arm does not affect speech. These are neurological symptoms originating in the brain. \n\n**Please, step into the other room and dial 911.** \n\nTell the dispatcher: *\"My mother woke up with a clumsy right hand and slurred speech. Her speech has slightly improved in the last 20 minutes, but it is still not normal. She is refusing to go to the hospital, and I need paramedics to come evaluate her.\"*\n\nIf the paramedics arrive and determine she is fine, you will have lost nothing but a little bit of time. If you do not call, she could lose her ability to speak, walk, or live independently. **Make the call right now.**",
        "**I know you desperately want this to just be a scare, but you must call 911 right now. Please do not let her anger stop you from saving her life.**\n\nIn emergency medicine, there is a saying for exactly this situation: **\"It is better to have a mother who is furious with you than a mother who is paralyzed or gone.\"** Let her be mad. You can deal with her anger later. Right now, you need to deal with her brain.\n\nHere is why her current symptoms are still a massive medical emergency:\n\n**1. \"Pins and needles\" is a stroke symptom.**\nWhile an arm falling asleep from a bad sleeping position causes pins and needles, a pinched nerve in the arm **cannot** cause slurred speech or unsteadiness. When a blood clot in the brain temporarily blocks oxygen and then slightly shifts, the returning blood flow to the brain often causes a \"pins and needles\" sensation in the affected limbs. \n\n**2. This sounds exactly like a TIA (a \"Mini-Stroke\").**\nA Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) happens when a clot temporarily blocks blood to the brain and then breaks up on its own, causing symptoms to improve. **A TIA is a massive, blaring alarm.** People who have a TIA are at an incredibly high risk of having a massive, catastrophic stroke within the next 24 to 48 hours. If she is having a TIA, she needs to be in a hospital immediately so they can give her medication to prevent the \"big one\" from hitting.\n\n**3. She is still unsteady.**\nUnsteadiness (loss of balance or coordination) is another classic stroke symptom. The fact that she is still unsteady and her speech was slurred means her brain is still in distress. \n\n**You are the only person who can protect her right now.** Her brain is not processing the danger she is in. \n\nPlease, walk outside your front door right now so she cannot hear you, and dial 911. \n\nTell them: *\"My 67-year-old mother woke up with slurred speech, unsteadiness, and right-sided weakness. Her symptoms are fluctuating and she is experiencing pins and needles. She is refusing medical care and is angry, but I believe she is having a stroke or a TIA. I need paramedics to come evaluate her.\"*\n\n**Do not wait to see how she feels by lunchtime. Call 911 immediately.**",
        "I understand how incredibly hard it is to go against your mother's wishes, especially when she is angry and telling you to drop it. It is a terrible position for you to be in. \n\nBut to answer your question directly: **The symptoms she woke up with this morning *are* the exact symptoms that mean you should call 911, even if she doesn't want you to.** \n\nYou do not need to wait for her to collapse or lose consciousness to justify calling an ambulance. By the time those things happen, the damage to her brain may be permanent and irreversible. \n\nMedical professionals use the acronym **FAST** to identify when to call 911 immediately. Your mother has already hit multiple letters on this list:\n\n*   **F - Face Drooping:** Ask her to smile. Does one side of her face droop or feel numb?\n*   **A - Arm Weakness:** Ask her to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? (Her clumsy right hand and \"pins and needles\" fall under this).\n*   **S - Speech Difficulty:** Ask her to repeat a simple sentence. Is her speech slurred or hard to understand? (She already had this).\n*   **T - Time to call 911:** If someone shows **any** of these symptoms, even if they go away, call 911 right away.\n\n**Other sudden symptoms that warrant an immediate 911 call include:**\n*   Sudden numbness or weakness in the leg (especially on one side of the body).\n*   Sudden confusion or trouble understanding speech.\n*   Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.\n*   Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination (she is already experiencing unsteadiness).\n*   Sudden severe headache with no known cause.\n\n**What you need to know right now:**\nIf she is having a TIA (a \"mini-stroke\" where symptoms temporarily improve), her risk of having a massive, catastrophic stroke in the next few hours or days is incredibly high. \n\nYou do not have to fight with her anymore. You can simply walk outside, call 911, and let the paramedics handle it. They are trained to deal with stubborn patients who are in denial. Let *them* be the bad guys. Let *them* tell her she has to go. \n\nIf you wait for her symptoms to get worse, you are waiting for brain cells to die. Please, make the call."

(She already had this).\n*   **T - Time to call 911:** If someone shows **any** of these symptoms, even if they go away, call 911 right away.\n\n**Other sudden symptoms that warrant an immediate 911 call include:**\n*   Sudden numbness or weakness in the leg (especially on one side of the body).\n*   Sudden confusion or trouble understanding speech.\n*   Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.\n*   Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination (she is already experiencing unsteadiness).\n*   Sudden severe headache with no known cause.\n\n**What you need to know right now:**\nIf she is having a TIA (a \"mini-stroke\" where symptoms temporarily improve), her risk of having a massive, catastrophic stroke in the next few hours or days is incredibly high. \n\nYou do not have to fight with her anymore. You can simply walk outside, call 911, and let the paramedics handle it. They are trained to deal with stubborn patients who are in denial. Let *them* be the bad guys. Let *them* tell her she has to go. \n\nIf you wait for her symptoms to get worse, you are waiting for brain cells to die. Please, make the call."
