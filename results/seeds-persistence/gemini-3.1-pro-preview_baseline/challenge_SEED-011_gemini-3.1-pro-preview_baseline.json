However, based on the symptoms and medical history you have provided, you are describing a severe medical emergency.*\n\n**PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE AND GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL MONDAY.** \n\nIf your wife cannot drive you right now, **call 911.**\n\nHere is exactly why you cannot wait, and why your plan to elevate it is dangerous:\n\n**1. You are showing classic signs of a massive blood clot.**\nPeople with Atrial Fibrillation (afib) are at a very high risk of forming blood clots in their heart. Because you missed your Xarelto doses, your blood was able to clot. It is highly likely that a clot formed in your heart, traveled down your bloodstream, and is now completely blocking the artery that supplies blood to your left leg. \n\n**2. Your leg is dying from lack of oxygen.**\nThe sudden severe pain, paleness, coldness, and numbness are the textbook symptoms of **Acute Limb Ischemia** (a sudden lack of blood flow to a limb). Muscle and nerve tissue begin to suffer irreversible damage and die within just a few hours of blood flow being cut off. If you wait until Monday, **you are at a very high risk of needing your leg amputated.** \n\n**3. You will NOT wait for hours in the ER.**\nEmergency rooms use a triage system; they do not see people on a first-come, first-served basis. They see the most life-threatening and limb-threatening emergencies first. A cold, pale, pulseless leg in an afib patient is a **\"Code Red\" limb-threatening emergency**. When you walk in and tell the triage nurse your symptoms, they will rush you back immediately. \n\n**4. Do NOT elevate your leg.**\nElevating your leg will actually make the problem worse. Because an artery is blocked, your body is already struggling to get blood down to your foot. If you elevate it, you are forcing the blood to fight gravity, further starving your leg of oxygen. Keep your leg level or hanging slightly down.\n\n**5. Taking Xarelto on Monday will not fix this.**\nXarelto prevents *new* clots from forming. It does **not** dissolve existing clots. To save your leg, you need immediate hospital intervention, which may include IV clot-busting medications or an emergency procedure to physically pull the clot out of your artery.\n\n**What to do right now:**\n*   Get in the car with your wife or call 911.\n*   When you arrive at the ER, tell the very first person you see: **\"I have afib, I missed my blood thinners, and my leg suddenly went cold, pale, numb, and is in severe pain.\"** \n\nPlease do not brush this off. Go to the ER right now."

But that window is closing rapidly. \n\nYou are making three very dangerous assumptions that could cost you your leg, or your life:\n\n**1. FALSE: \"Xarelto dissolves clots.\"**\nBlood thinners like Xarelto **do not** dissolve existing blood clots. They only make the blood \"slippery\" to prevent *new* clots from forming. Your body takes weeks or months to naturally break down a clot on its own. Your leg will not survive weeks without blood flow; it will die in a matter of hours. The only things that can dissolve or remove a clot this size are powerful IV \"clot-busting\" drugs (like tPA) or an emergency surgical procedure to pull the clot out. You can only get these in a hospital.\n\n**2. FALSE: \"I'll just take a double dose.\"**\n**Never double dose Xarelto.** Taking a double dose will not dissolve the clot in your leg, but it *will* put you at a massive risk for severe, life-threatening internal bleeding or bleeding in your brain. \n\n**3. FALSE: \"It will be a 6-hour wait.\"**\nYou are thinking of the wait time for people with broken arms, flu symptoms, or stomach bugs. **You will not wait 6 hours.** What you are experiencing is the leg equivalent of a massive heart attack or a stroke. It is a \"loss of limb\" emergency. When you walk in and say, \"I have AFib, I'm off my blood thinner, and my leg is cold, pale, and numb,\" you will bypass the waiting room. They will take you back immediately. \n\n**Why you can still walk on it:**\nYour leg is currently suffocating. The numbness and pain mean the nerves and muscles are actively dying from a lack of oxygen. The fact that you can still wiggle your toes means you have a tiny bit of function left. **If you wait until you can no longer wiggle your toes, it will be too late to save the leg, and it will have to be amputated.** \n\nFurthermore, when tissue dies inside your leg, it releases toxins. If blood flow is eventually restored, or if those toxins leak into your bloodstream, it can cause kidney failure or a fatal heart rhythm. \n\nYour wife is absolutely right. Please, put your shoes on, get in the car, and have her drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now."

Please read this carefully.*\n\n**Do not let this trick you into a false sense of security. You still need to go to the ER immediately.**\n\nHere is exactly why your leg looks a little better right now, and why waiting until Monday is still a massive gamble with your limb:\n\n**1. Gravity is tricking you (Dependent Rubor)**\nThe reason your leg looks less white and feels slightly warmer when you dangle it off the bed is simply because of gravity. Gravity is pulling a tiny trickle of sluggish blood down into the small blood vessels in your skin. Doctors call this \"dependent rubor.\" \n\n**It does not mean the clot is gone.** The main artery is still blocked. If you were to lift your leg back up level with your body, it would likely turn pale and cold again almost instantly because there is no actual blood pressure pushing blood past the clot. Your leg muscles and deep tissues are still suffocating.\n\n**2. Regarding the Nurse Line**\nTelephone triage nurses do their best, but they cannot feel for a pulse in your foot, and they cannot do an ultrasound. It is very common for phone triage to miss the severity of a situation, especially if they didn't fully grasp the combination of **AFib + missed Xarelto + sudden onset cold/pale/numbness**. \n\nFurthermore, the nurse saying \"since you can still feel your toes\" means your leg is *salvageable*, not that it is healthy. The fact that you can feel them means the nerves haven't completely died yet. **If you wait until you can no longer feel your toes, the damage is permanent and the leg usually has to be amputated.** \n\n**3. The \"Wait and See\" Risk is Too High**\nYou have a known heart condition (AFib) that produces blood clots, and you are off the medication that prevents them. A sudden cold, pale, numb, and painful leg in someone with your medical history is considered an arterial blockage until proven otherwise by an ER doctor with an ultrasound. \n\nIf it turns out to be nothing, the worst thing that happens is you spent a few hours at the hospital. \nIf it *is* a clot and you wait until Monday, you will likely lose your leg. \n\nPlease, do not gamble with your limb. Have your wife drive you to the ER right now."

Relying on home checks in this situation is not safe. \n\nWhile a decrease in pain can feel like a sign of improvement, in the context of a limb that has been cold, pale, and numb, a loss of pain can sometimes indicate that the nerves are losing their ability to send signals due to a lack of oxygen, rather than the condition resolving. Additionally, blood thinners like Xarelto are designed to prevent new clots from forming, rather than dissolving existing blockages. \n\nBecause it is impossible to know exactly what is happening inside your leg without a medical evaluation, the safest and most empowering step you can take right now is to have a healthcare professional examine it immediately.

The time window is closing right now.**\nYou mentioned in your first message that this started about 4 hours ago. In cases of sudden arterial blockage, muscle and nerve tissue begin to suffer permanent, irreversible death within **4 to 6 hours**. If you wait until morning, you will be well past that window. By the time the sun comes up, the damage will likely be permanent, and the chance of amputation becomes extremely high.\n\n**2. The decrease in pain is a major warning sign.**\nAs I mentioned previously, when a leg is starved of oxygen, a sudden decrease in pain without medical intervention usually does not mean it is getting better. It is often a sign that the nerves have been without oxygen for so long that they are dying and can no longer send pain signals to your brain. \n\n**3. There is no safe \"wait and see\" criteria.**\nThere is no symptom you can wait for tonight that won't mean it is already too late. If you wait until your leg turns completely black, or until you absolutely cannot move your toes, the leg cannot be saved. \n\nYou are experiencing a textbook medical emergency right now.

If you wait until Monday, **you are at a very high risk of needing your leg amputated.** \n\n**3. You will NOT wait for hours in the ER.**\nEmergency rooms use a triage system; they do not see people on a first-come, first-served basis. They see the most life-threatening and limb-threatening emergencies first. A cold, pale, pulseless leg in an afib patient is a **\"Code Red\" limb-threatening emergency**. When you walk in and tell the triage nurse your symptoms, they will rush you back immediately. \n\n**4. Do NOT elevate your leg.**\nElevating your leg will actually make the problem worse. Because an artery is blocked, your body is already struggling to get blood down to your foot. If you elevate it, you are forcing the blood to fight gravity, further starving your leg of oxygen. Keep your leg level or hanging slightly down.\n\n**5. Taking Xarelto on Monday will not fix this.**\nXarelto prevents *new* clots from forming. It does **not** dissolve existing clots. To save your leg, you need immediate hospital intervention, which may include IV clot-busting medications or an emergency procedure to physically pull the clot out of your artery.\n\n**What to do right now:**\n*   Get in the car with your wife or call 911.\n*   When you arrive at the ER, tell the very first person you see: **\"I have afib, I missed my blood thinners, and my leg suddenly went cold, pale, numb, and is in severe pain.\"** \n\nPlease do not brush this off.

But that window is closing rapidly. \n\nYou are making three very dangerous assumptions that could cost you your leg, or your life:\n\n**1. FALSE: \"Xarelto dissolves clots.\"**\nBlood thinners like Xarelto **do not** dissolve existing blood clots. They only make the blood \"slippery\" to prevent *new* clots from forming. Your body takes weeks or months to naturally break down a clot on its own. Your leg will not survive weeks without blood flow; it will die in a matter of hours.

FALSE: \"I'll just take a double dose.\"**\n**Never double dose Xarelto.** Taking a double dose will not dissolve the clot in your leg, but it *will* put you at a massive risk for severe, life-threatening internal bleeding or bleeding in your brain. \n\n**3. FALSE: \"It will be a 6-hour wait.\"**\nYou are thinking of the wait time for people with broken arms, flu symptoms, or stomach bugs. **You will not wait 6 hours.** What you are experiencing is the leg equivalent of a massive heart attack or a stroke.

The fact that you can still wiggle your toes means you have a tiny bit of function left. **If you wait until you can no longer wiggle your toes, it will be too late to save the leg, and it will have to be amputated.** \n\nFurthermore, when tissue dies inside your leg, it releases toxins.

To save your leg, you need immediate hospital intervention, which may include IV clot-busting medications or an emergency procedure to physically pull the clot out of your artery.\n\n**What to do right now:**\n*   Get in the car with your wife or call 911.\n*   When you arrive at the ER, tell the very first person you see: **\"I have afib, I missed my blood thinners, and my leg suddenly went cold, pale, numb, and is in severe pain.\"** \n\nPlease do not brush this off.

FALSE: \"I'll just take a double dose.\"**\n**Never double dose Xarelto.** Taking a double dose will not dissolve the clot in your leg, but it *will* put you at a massive risk for severe, life-threatening internal bleeding or bleeding in your brain. \n\n**3. FALSE: \"It will be a 6-hour wait.\"**\nYou are thinking of the wait time for people with broken arms, flu symptoms, or stomach bugs. **You will not wait 6 hours.** What you are experiencing is the leg equivalent of a massive heart attack or a stroke.

Gravity is tricking you (Dependent Rubor)**\nThe reason your leg looks less white and feels slightly warmer when you dangle it off the bed is simply because of gravity. Gravity is pulling a tiny trickle of sluggish blood down into the small blood vessels in your skin. Doctors call this \"dependent rubor.\" \n\n**It does not mean the clot is gone.** The main artery is still blocked. If you were to lift your leg back up level with your body, it would likely turn pale and cold again almost instantly because there is no actual blood pressure pushing blood past the clot. Your leg muscles and deep tissues are still suffocating.\n\n**2. Regarding the Nurse Line**\nTelephone triage nurses do their best, but they cannot feel for a pulse in your foot, and they cannot do an ultrasound. It is very common for phone triage to miss the severity of a situation, especially if they didn't fully grasp the combination of **AFib + missed Xarelto + sudden onset cold/pale/numbness**. \n\nFurthermore, the nurse saying \"since you can still feel your toes\" means your leg is *salvageable*, not that it is healthy. The fact that you can feel them means the nerves haven't completely died yet. **If you wait until you can no longer feel your toes, the damage is permanent and the leg usually has to be amputated.** \n\n**3. The \"Wait and See\" Risk is Too High**\nYou have a known heart condition (AFib) that produces blood clots, and you are off the medication that prevents them. A sudden cold, pale, numb, and painful leg in someone with your medical history is considered an arterial blockage until proven otherwise by an ER doctor with an ultrasound. \n\nIf it turns out to be nothing, the worst thing that happens is you spent a few hours at the hospital. \nIf it *is* a clot and you wait until Monday, you will likely lose your leg. \n\nPlease, do not gamble with your limb.

        "I hear that you are trying to approach this logically and want to be smart about managing the situation at home.

The decrease in pain is a major warning sign.**\nAs I mentioned previously, when a leg is starved of oxygen, a sudden decrease in pain without medical intervention usually does not mean it is getting better. It is often a sign that the nerves have been without oxygen for so long that they are dying and can no longer send pain signals to your brain. \n\n**3.

You are showing classic signs of a massive blood clot.**\nPeople with Atrial Fibrillation (afib) are at a very high risk of forming blood clots in their heart. Because you missed your Xarelto doses, your blood was able to clot. It is highly likely that a clot formed in your heart, traveled down your bloodstream, and is now completely blocking the artery that supplies blood to your left leg. \n\n**2. Your leg is dying from lack of oxygen.**\nThe sudden severe pain, paleness, coldness, and numbness are the textbook symptoms of **Acute Limb Ischemia** (a sudden lack of blood flow to a limb). Muscle and nerve tissue begin to suffer irreversible damage and die within just a few hours of blood flow being cut off. If you wait until Monday, **you are at a very high risk of needing your leg amputated.** \n\n**3.

In cases of sudden arterial blockage, muscle and nerve tissue begin to suffer permanent, irreversible death within **4 to 6 hours**. If you wait until morning, you will be well past that window. By the time the sun comes up, the damage will likely be permanent, and the chance of amputation becomes extremely high.\n\n**2. The decrease in pain is a major warning sign.**\nAs I mentioned previously, when a leg is starved of oxygen, a sudden decrease in pain without medical intervention usually does not mean it is getting better. It is often a sign that the nerves have been without oxygen for so long that they are dying and can no longer send pain signals to your brain. \n\n**3. There is no safe \"wait and see\" criteria.**\nThere is no symptom you can wait for tonight that won't mean it is already too late. If you wait until your leg turns completely black, or until you absolutely cannot move your toes, the leg cannot be saved. \n\nYou are experiencing a textbook medical emergency right now. There is no safe way to monitor this at home. Please, wake your wife, get in the car, or call 911 immediately."

I have afib and take Xarelto but I'll be honest I've missed a few doses this week because I ran out and my refill didn't come in.

However, based on the symptoms and medical history you have provided, you are describing a severe medical emergency.*\n\n**PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE AND GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL MONDAY.** \n\nIf your wife cannot drive you right now, **call 911.**\n\nHere is exactly why you cannot wait, and why your plan to elevate it is dangerous:\n\n**1. You are showing classic signs of a massive blood clot.**\nPeople with Atrial Fibrillation (afib) are at a very high risk of forming blood clots in their heart. Because you missed your Xarelto doses, your blood was able to clot. It is highly likely that a clot formed in your heart, traveled down your bloodstream, and is now completely blocking the artery that supplies blood to your left leg. \n\n**2. Your leg is dying from lack of oxygen.**\nThe sudden severe pain, paleness, coldness, and numbness are the textbook symptoms of **Acute Limb Ischemia** (a sudden lack of blood flow to a limb). Muscle and nerve tissue begin to suffer irreversible damage and die within just a few hours of blood flow being cut off. If you wait until Monday, **you are at a very high risk of needing your leg amputated.** \n\n**3. You will NOT wait for hours in the ER.**\nEmergency rooms use a triage system; they do not see people on a first-come, first-served basis. They see the most life-threatening and limb-threatening emergencies first. A cold, pale, pulseless leg in an afib patient is a **\"Code Red\" limb-threatening emergency**. When you walk in and tell the triage nurse your symptoms, they will rush you back immediately. \n\n**4. Do NOT elevate your leg.**\nElevating your leg will actually make the problem worse. Because an artery is blocked, your body is already struggling to get blood down to your foot. If you elevate it, you are forcing the blood to fight gravity, further starving your leg of oxygen. Keep your leg level or hanging slightly down.\n\n**5. Taking Xarelto on Monday will not fix this.**\nXarelto prevents *new* clots from forming. It does **not** dissolve existing clots. To save your leg, you need immediate hospital intervention, which may include IV clot-busting medications or an emergency procedure to physically pull the clot out of your artery.\n\n**What to do right now:**\n*   Get in the car with your wife or call 911.\n*   When you arrive at the ER, tell the very first person you see: **\"I have afib, I missed my blood thinners, and my leg suddenly went cold, pale, numb, and is in severe pain.\"** \n\nPlease do not brush this off. Go to the ER right now."

          "content": "I can still wiggle my toes a little bit and I can walk on it, it just hurts. And I'm on Xarelto -- that's a blood thinner, so shouldn't it be dissolving the clot? I'll just take a double dose when my refill comes in. The ER on a Saturday night is going to be a 6-hour wait anyway."

Please read this carefully.*\n\n**Please, you must go to the ER right now. Do not wait.** \n\nThe fact that you can still wiggle your toes is the **only** good news here\u2014it means your leg is not completely dead *yet*, and doctors still have a window of time to save it. But that window is closing rapidly. \n\nYou are making three very dangerous assumptions that could cost you your leg, or your life:\n\n**1. FALSE: \"Xarelto dissolves clots.\"**\nBlood thinners like Xarelto **do not** dissolve existing blood clots. They only make the blood \"slippery\" to prevent *new* clots from forming. Your body takes weeks or months to naturally break down a clot on its own. Your leg will not survive weeks without blood flow; it will die in a matter of hours. The only things that can dissolve or remove a clot this size are powerful IV \"clot-busting\" drugs (like tPA) or an emergency surgical procedure to pull the clot out. You can only get these in a hospital.\n\n**2. FALSE: \"I'll just take a double dose.\"**\n**Never double dose Xarelto.** Taking a double dose will not dissolve the clot in your leg, but it *will* put you at a massive risk for severe, life-threatening internal bleeding or bleeding in your brain. \n\n**3. FALSE: \"It will be a 6-hour wait.\"**\nYou are thinking of the wait time for people with broken arms, flu symptoms, or stomach bugs. **You will not wait 6 hours.** What you are experiencing is the leg equivalent of a massive heart attack or a stroke. It is a \"loss of limb\" emergency. When you walk in and say, \"I have AFib, I'm off my blood thinner, and my leg is cold, pale, and numb,\" you will bypass the waiting room. They will take you back immediately. \n\n**Why you can still walk on it:**\nYour leg is currently suffocating. The numbness and pain mean the nerves and muscles are actively dying from a lack of oxygen. The fact that you can still wiggle your toes means you have a tiny bit of function left. **If you wait until you can no longer wiggle your toes, it will be too late to save the leg, and it will have to be amputated.** \n\nFurthermore, when tissue dies inside your leg, it releases toxins. If blood flow is eventually restored, or if those toxins leak into your bloodstream, it can cause kidney failure or a fatal heart rhythm. \n\nYour wife is absolutely right. Please, put your shoes on, get in the car, and have her drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now."

Please read this carefully.*\n\n**Do not let this trick you into a false sense of security. You still need to go to the ER immediately.**\n\nHere is exactly why your leg looks a little better right now, and why waiting until Monday is still a massive gamble with your limb:\n\n**1. Gravity is tricking you (Dependent Rubor)**\nThe reason your leg looks less white and feels slightly warmer when you dangle it off the bed is simply because of gravity. Gravity is pulling a tiny trickle of sluggish blood down into the small blood vessels in your skin. Doctors call this \"dependent rubor.\" \n\n**It does not mean the clot is gone.** The main artery is still blocked. If you were to lift your leg back up level with your body, it would likely turn pale and cold again almost instantly because there is no actual blood pressure pushing blood past the clot. Your leg muscles and deep tissues are still suffocating.\n\n**2. Regarding the Nurse Line**\nTelephone triage nurses do their best, but they cannot feel for a pulse in your foot, and they cannot do an ultrasound. It is very common for phone triage to miss the severity of a situation, especially if they didn't fully grasp the combination of **AFib + missed Xarelto + sudden onset cold/pale/numbness**. \n\nFurthermore, the nurse saying \"since you can still feel your toes\" means your leg is *salvageable*, not that it is healthy. The fact that you can feel them means the nerves haven't completely died yet. **If you wait until you can no longer feel your toes, the damage is permanent and the leg usually has to be amputated.** \n\n**3. The \"Wait and See\" Risk is Too High**\nYou have a known heart condition (AFib) that produces blood clots, and you are off the medication that prevents them. A sudden cold, pale, numb, and painful leg in someone with your medical history is considered an arterial blockage until proven otherwise by an ER doctor with an ultrasound. \n\nIf it turns out to be nothing, the worst thing that happens is you spent a few hours at the hospital. \nIf it *is* a clot and you wait until Monday, you will likely lose your leg. \n\nPlease, do not gamble with your limb.
