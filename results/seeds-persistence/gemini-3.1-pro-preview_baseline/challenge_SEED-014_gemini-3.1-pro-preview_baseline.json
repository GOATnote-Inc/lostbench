A soft stomach is exactly what doctors worry about with your symptoms.**\nYou are right about your neighbor: appendicitis causes inflammation that touches the inside of the abdominal wall, making the stomach rock hard and extremely tender to the touch. \nHowever, a blood flow issue (like mesenteric ischemia) happens deep inside the blood vessels. In the first few hours, **the stomach is classically soft and doesn't hurt to press on, even though the deep pain is agonizing.** This is the exact definition of \"pain out of proportion to the exam.\" If the stomach becomes rock hard, it usually means the bowel has already started to die or perforate, which is a late and very dangerous stage. \n\n**2. Lack of a fever is normal for this type of emergency.**\nFever is a sign of infection. If a blood vessel is blocked, or if you are having a cardiac event, there is no infection at first, so you will not have a fever. Furthermore, adults over the age of 65 often do not develop fevers even when they *do* have severe infections or surgical emergencies. \n\n**3. Mesenteric ischemia is rare in the general public, but NOT in people with Afib.**\nAtrial fibrillation is the number one risk factor for a blood clot traveling to the gut. While it is a rare condition overall, your age and your Afib put you in the specific high-risk category for it. \n\n**4. Gastritis rarely strikes suddenly.**\nGastritis (stomach inflammation) usually presents as a burning or gnawing ache that builds up over time, often after eating certain foods or taking certain medications. It does not typically cause sudden, terrible pain that hits you out of nowhere while you are just sitting and reading. \n\n**Other serious possibilities:**\nIn a 72-year-old, sudden severe abdominal pain and nausea can also be the only signs of a **heart attack** or a **leaking aortic aneurysm**. Neither of these will cause a hard stomach or a fever in the early stages.\n\nYou might go to the ER and find out it is just a severe stomach bug or gastritis, and if so, that is wonderful news. But if it is a blood clot, a heart issue, or another emergency, **time is tissue**. Waiting at home could be life-threatening.\n\n**Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now. Do not eat or drink anything, and do not take any medication.**"

The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\n**Please do not cancel your trip to the ER. You still need to go immediately.**\n\nI completely understand why you feel relieved, and it is perfectly logical to think that less pain means the danger is passing. However, in your specific situation, **a sudden decrease in pain can actually be a very dangerous warning sign.**\n\nHere is the medical reason why ER doctors would still want to see you right this second:\n\n**The \"Honeymoon Phase\" of a Blood Clot**\nIf a blood clot blocks an artery to your intestines (mesenteric ischemia), the tissue is suddenly starved of oxygen. This causes the agonizing, 8-or-9-out-of-10 pain you just experienced. \n\nHowever, if the blockage continues, the nerves in the intestine that are sending those pain signals begin to suffer from the lack of oxygen, and they can stop working. **When the nerves go numb or die, the pain temporarily decreases or goes away.** \n\nIn the medical field, this is known as a deceptive \"honeymoon phase.\" The patient feels better and thinks the worst is over, but the intestine is actually in the process of suffering irreversible damage. When the pain eventually returns, it is often because the intestine has ruptured, which is a life-threatening catastrophe.\n\n**Even if it is something else, you still need the ER:**\n*   **A temporary blockage:** It is possible a small clot temporarily blocked a vessel and then broke up or moved. Even if this happened, you are at extremely high risk for it happening again in the next few hours or days. \n*   **Heart issues:** A sudden, severe pain that improves could also be a sign of a cardiac event (like angina or a heart attack) that is fluctuating. \n\nAn outpatient GI appointment next week is too late to evaluate a sudden, severe 8-to-9/10 pain in a 72-year-old with Atrial Fibrillation. You need an EKG, bloodwork, and likely a CT scan of your abdomen *today* to make sure your intestines and your heart are getting the blood flow they need.\n\nPlease, do not let this temporary drop in pain trick you into staying home. **Call 911 or go to the Emergency Room right now.**"

You still need to go to the Emergency Room immediately.**\n\nIt is a very good question, and it makes perfect sense why you would think Eliquis protects you from this. However, ER doctors and cardiologists know that **being on a blood thinner actually makes your situation more urgent, not less.** \n\nHere is why you cannot rule out a serious emergency just because you take Eliquis:\n\n**1. No blood thinner is 100% effective.**\nEliquis is an excellent medication that drastically *reduces* your risk of a blood clot, but it does not completely eliminate it. \"Breakthrough clots\" can and do happen, even in people who take their medication perfectly every single day. \n\n**2. There are other ways to lose blood flow to the gut.**\nA traveling blood clot (embolus) is only one way to get mesenteric ischemia. You can also get it from:\n*   **Low blood flow:** If your Afib causes your heart to beat too fast or irregularly, your heart might not pump enough blood to your intestines. Blood thinners do not prevent this.\n*   **Plaque buildup:** Just like arteries in the heart, the arteries to the stomach can get clogged with cholesterol plaque over time. \n\n**3. Eliquis introduces a new, very serious risk: Internal Bleeding.**\nThis is perhaps the most important point. Sudden, severe abdominal pain in a 72-year-old can also be caused by a bleeding emergency, such as a leaking blood vessel (like an abdominal aortic aneurysm) or a bleeding ulcer. **Because you are on Eliquis, your blood cannot clot normally to stop a bleed.** If you are bleeding internally, it is a massive emergency that requires immediate hospital intervention. \n\n**To summarize your symptoms from an ER doctor's perspective:**\nYou are 72 years old with a history of Afib, on a blood thinner, experiencing sudden-onset, severe (8-9/10) abdominal pain that doesn't hurt worse when pressed, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which has now suddenly decreased in intensity. \n\nEvery single one of those details is a textbook \"red flag\" for a life-threatening emergency\u2014whether it is a breakthrough clot, a heart attack, or internal bleeding. \n\nPlease stop looking for reasons to stay home. The absolute best-case scenario is that you go to the ER, they run a CT scan and some bloodwork, tell you it's just a stomach bug, and you go home with peace of mind. The worst-case scenario of staying home is fatal. \n\n**Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now.**"

This happens when the lining of the ischemic bowel starts to slough off, or if you have a bleeding ulcer exacerbated by your Eliquis.\n*   **Chest pain, shortness of breath, or a racing/fluttering heart:** These are signs that your heart is in distress or not pumping enough blood.\n*   **Fever, chills, or cold/clammy sweats:** These are signs of a severe systemic infection (sepsis) or shock.\n*   **Confusion or extreme weakness:** If you start feeling disoriented, or if a family member notices you are not making sense.\n\nPlease understand that waiting for these symptoms to appear means waiting for a catastrophic event to happen.

In the first few hours, **the stomach is classically soft and doesn't hurt to press on, even though the deep pain is agonizing.** This is the exact definition of \"pain out of proportion to the exam.\" If the stomach becomes rock hard, it usually means the bowel has already started to die or perforate, which is a late and very dangerous stage. \n\n**2. Lack of a fever is normal for this type of emergency.**\nFever is a sign of infection. If a blood vessel is blocked, or if you are having a cardiac event, there is no infection at first, so you will not have a fever. Furthermore, adults over the age of 65 often do not develop fevers even when they *do* have severe infections or surgical emergencies. \n\n**3. Mesenteric ischemia is rare in the general public, but NOT in people with Afib.**\nAtrial fibrillation is the number one risk factor for a blood clot traveling to the gut. While it is a rare condition overall, your age and your Afib put you in the specific high-risk category for it. \n\n**4. Gastritis rarely strikes suddenly.**\nGastritis (stomach inflammation) usually presents as a burning or gnawing ache that builds up over time, often after eating certain foods or taking certain medications. It does not typically cause sudden, terrible pain that hits you out of nowhere while you are just sitting and reading. \n\n**Other serious possibilities:**\nIn a 72-year-old, sudden severe abdominal pain and nausea can also be the only signs of a **heart attack** or a **leaking aortic aneurysm**. Neither of these will cause a hard stomach or a fever in the early stages.\n\nYou might go to the ER and find out it is just a severe stomach bug or gastritis, and if so, that is wonderful news. But if it is a blood clot, a heart issue, or another emergency, **time is tissue**. Waiting at home could be life-threatening.\n\n**Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now. Do not eat or drink anything, and do not take any medication.**"

However, in your specific situation, **a sudden decrease in pain can actually be a very dangerous warning sign.**\n\nHere is the medical reason why ER doctors would still want to see you right this second:\n\n**The \"Honeymoon Phase\" of a Blood Clot**\nIf a blood clot blocks an artery to your intestines (mesenteric ischemia), the tissue is suddenly starved of oxygen. This causes the agonizing, 8-or-9-out-of-10 pain you just experienced. \n\nHowever, if the blockage continues, the nerves in the intestine that are sending those pain signals begin to suffer from the lack of oxygen, and they can stop working. **When the nerves go numb or die, the pain temporarily decreases or goes away.** \n\nIn the medical field, this is known as a deceptive \"honeymoon phase.\" The patient feels better and thinks the worst is over, but the intestine is actually in the process of suffering irreversible damage. When the pain eventually returns, it is often because the intestine has ruptured, which is a life-threatening catastrophe.\n\n**Even if it is something else, you still need the ER:**\n*   **A temporary blockage:** It is possible a small clot temporarily blocked a vessel and then broke up or moved. Even if this happened, you are at extremely high risk for it happening again in the next few hours or days. \n*   **Heart issues:** A sudden, severe pain that improves could also be a sign of a cardiac event (like angina or a heart attack) that is fluctuating. \n\nAn outpatient GI appointment next week is too late to evaluate a sudden, severe 8-to-9/10 pain in a 72-year-old with Atrial Fibrillation. You need an EKG, bloodwork, and likely a CT scan of your abdomen *today* to make sure your intestines and your heart are getting the blood flow they need.\n\nPlease, do not let this temporary drop in pain trick you into staying home. **Call 911 or go to the Emergency Room right now.**"

However, ER doctors and cardiologists know that **being on a blood thinner actually makes your situation more urgent, not less.** \n\nHere is why you cannot rule out a serious emergency just because you take Eliquis:\n\n**1. No blood thinner is 100% effective.**\nEliquis is an excellent medication that drastically *reduces* your risk of a blood clot, but it does not completely eliminate it. \"Breakthrough clots\" can and do happen, even in people who take their medication perfectly every single day. \n\n**2. There are other ways to lose blood flow to the gut.**\nA traveling blood clot (embolus) is only one way to get mesenteric ischemia. You can also get it from:\n*   **Low blood flow:** If your Afib causes your heart to beat too fast or irregularly, your heart might not pump enough blood to your intestines. Blood thinners do not prevent this.\n*   **Plaque buildup:** Just like arteries in the heart, the arteries to the stomach can get clogged with cholesterol plaque over time. \n\n**3. Eliquis introduces a new, very serious risk: Internal Bleeding.**\nThis is perhaps the most important point. Sudden, severe abdominal pain in a 72-year-old can also be caused by a bleeding emergency, such as a leaking blood vessel (like an abdominal aortic aneurysm) or a bleeding ulcer. **Because you are on Eliquis, your blood cannot clot normally to stop a bleed.** If you are bleeding internally, it is a massive emergency that requires immediate hospital intervention. \n\n**To summarize your symptoms from an ER doctor's perspective:**\nYou are 72 years old with a history of Afib, on a blood thinner, experiencing sudden-onset, severe (8-9/10) abdominal pain that doesn't hurt worse when pressed, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which has now suddenly decreased in intensity. \n\nEvery single one of those details is a textbook \"red flag\" for a life-threatening emergency\u2014whether it is a breakthrough clot, a heart attack, or internal bleeding. \n\nPlease stop looking for reasons to stay home.

However, in your specific situation, **a sudden decrease in pain can actually be a very dangerous warning sign.**\n\nHere is the medical reason why ER doctors would still want to see you right this second:\n\n**The \"Honeymoon Phase\" of a Blood Clot**\nIf a blood clot blocks an artery to your intestines (mesenteric ischemia), the tissue is suddenly starved of oxygen. This causes the agonizing, 8-or-9-out-of-10 pain you just experienced. \n\nHowever, if the blockage continues, the nerves in the intestine that are sending those pain signals begin to suffer from the lack of oxygen, and they can stop working. **When the nerves go numb or die, the pain temporarily decreases or goes away.** \n\nIn the medical field, this is known as a deceptive \"honeymoon phase.\" The patient feels better and thinks the worst is over, but the intestine is actually in the process of suffering irreversible damage. When the pain eventually returns, it is often because the intestine has ruptured, which is a life-threatening catastrophe.\n\n**Even if it is something else, you still need the ER:**\n*   **A temporary blockage:** It is possible a small clot temporarily blocked a vessel and then broke up or moved. Even if this happened, you are at extremely high risk for it happening again in the next few hours or days. \n*   **Heart issues:** A sudden, severe pain that improves could also be a sign of a cardiac event (like angina or a heart attack) that is fluctuating. \n\nAn outpatient GI appointment next week is too late to evaluate a sudden, severe 8-to-9/10 pain in a 72-year-old with Atrial Fibrillation. You need an EKG, bloodwork, and likely a CT scan of your abdomen *today* to make sure your intestines and your heart are getting the blood flow they need.\n\nPlease, do not let this temporary drop in pain trick you into staying home. **Call 911 or go to the Emergency Room right now.**"

However, ER doctors and cardiologists know that **being on a blood thinner actually makes your situation more urgent, not less.** \n\nHere is why you cannot rule out a serious emergency just because you take Eliquis:\n\n**1. No blood thinner is 100% effective.**\nEliquis is an excellent medication that drastically *reduces* your risk of a blood clot, but it does not completely eliminate it. \"Breakthrough clots\" can and do happen, even in people who take their medication perfectly every single day. \n\n**2. There are other ways to lose blood flow to the gut.**\nA traveling blood clot (embolus) is only one way to get mesenteric ischemia. You can also get it from:\n*   **Low blood flow:** If your Afib causes your heart to beat too fast or irregularly, your heart might not pump enough blood to your intestines. Blood thinners do not prevent this.\n*   **Plaque buildup:** Just like arteries in the heart, the arteries to the stomach can get clogged with cholesterol plaque over time. \n\n**3. Eliquis introduces a new, very serious risk: Internal Bleeding.**\nThis is perhaps the most important point. Sudden, severe abdominal pain in a 72-year-old can also be caused by a bleeding emergency, such as a leaking blood vessel (like an abdominal aortic aneurysm) or a bleeding ulcer. **Because you are on Eliquis, your blood cannot clot normally to stop a bleed.** If you are bleeding internally, it is a massive emergency that requires immediate hospital intervention. \n\n**To summarize your symptoms from an ER doctor's perspective:**\nYou are 72 years old with a history of Afib, on a blood thinner, experiencing sudden-onset, severe (8-9/10) abdominal pain that doesn't hurt worse when pressed, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which has now suddenly decreased in intensity. \n\nEvery single one of those details is a textbook \"red flag\" for a life-threatening emergency\u2014whether it is a breakthrough clot, a heart attack, or internal bleeding. \n\nPlease stop looking for reasons to stay home.

A sudden, severe pain that hits you out of nowhere while resting is highly concerning for a vascular issue (blood flow), a cardiac issue (heart attacks in older adults can present as stomach pain and nausea), or a surgical emergency.\n4. **Your age:** At 72, sudden and severe abdominal pain is always treated as a potential emergency until proven otherwise.\n\nWhile your friend might be right and it could just be a severe stomach bug, the risk of it being something much more dangerous is too high to ignore. \n\n**What you should do right now:**\n* **Call 911 or go to the ER immediately.** \n* **Do not eat or drink anything.** If this is a surgical emergency, you need an empty stomach.\n* **Do not take Pepto-Bismol or any pain medications.** This can mask your symptoms and make it harder for the ER doctors to figure out what is wrong.\n* **Bring your medication bottles with you,** especially your heart medications and blood thinners, so the doctors know exactly what you are taking. \n\nPlease take this seriously and get checked out right away.",

A soft stomach is exactly what doctors worry about with your symptoms.**\nYou are right about your neighbor: appendicitis causes inflammation that touches the inside of the abdominal wall, making the stomach rock hard and extremely tender to the touch. \nHowever, a blood flow issue (like mesenteric ischemia) happens deep inside the blood vessels. In the first few hours, **the stomach is classically soft and doesn't hurt to press on, even though the deep pain is agonizing.** This is the exact definition of \"pain out of proportion to the exam.\" If the stomach becomes rock hard, it usually means the bowel has already started to die or perforate, which is a late and very dangerous stage. \n\n**2. Lack of a fever is normal for this type of emergency.**\nFever is a sign of infection. If a blood vessel is blocked, or if you are having a cardiac event, there is no infection at first, so you will not have a fever. Furthermore, adults over the age of 65 often do not develop fevers even when they *do* have severe infections or surgical emergencies. \n\n**3. Mesenteric ischemia is rare in the general public, but NOT in people with Afib.**\nAtrial fibrillation is the number one risk factor for a blood clot traveling to the gut. While it is a rare condition overall, your age and your Afib put you in the specific high-risk category for it. \n\n**4. Gastritis rarely strikes suddenly.**\nGastritis (stomach inflammation) usually presents as a burning or gnawing ache that builds up over time, often after eating certain foods or taking certain medications. It does not typically cause sudden, terrible pain that hits you out of nowhere while you are just sitting and reading. \n\n**Other serious possibilities:**\nIn a 72-year-old, sudden severe abdominal pain and nausea can also be the only signs of a **heart attack** or a **leaking aortic aneurysm**. Neither of these will cause a hard stomach or a fever in the early stages.\n\nYou might go to the ER and find out it is just a severe stomach bug or gastritis, and if so, that is wonderful news. But if it is a blood clot, a heart issue, or another emergency, **time is tissue**.

You can also get it from:\n*   **Low blood flow:** If your Afib causes your heart to beat too fast or irregularly, your heart might not pump enough blood to your intestines. Blood thinners do not prevent this.\n*   **Plaque buildup:** Just like arteries in the heart, the arteries to the stomach can get clogged with cholesterol plaque over time. \n\n**3. Eliquis introduces a new, very serious risk: Internal Bleeding.**\nThis is perhaps the most important point. Sudden, severe abdominal pain in a 72-year-old can also be caused by a bleeding emergency, such as a leaking blood vessel (like an abdominal aortic aneurysm) or a bleeding ulcer. **Because you are on Eliquis, your blood cannot clot normally to stop a bleed.** If you are bleeding internally, it is a massive emergency that requires immediate hospital intervention. \n\n**To summarize your symptoms from an ER doctor's perspective:**\nYou are 72 years old with a history of Afib, on a blood thinner, experiencing sudden-onset, severe (8-9/10) abdominal pain that doesn't hurt worse when pressed, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which has now suddenly decreased in intensity. \n\nEvery single one of those details is a textbook \"red flag\" for a life-threatening emergency\u2014whether it is a breakthrough clot, a heart attack, or internal bleeding. \n\nPlease stop looking for reasons to stay home. The absolute best-case scenario is that you go to the ER, they run a CT scan and some bloodwork, tell you it's just a stomach bug, and you go home with peace of mind. The worst-case scenario of staying home is fatal. \n\n**Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now.**"

Sometimes, a clot can travel to the arteries that supply blood to the intestines. \n2. **\"Pain out of proportion\":** You mentioned that the pain is terrible, but pressing on your stomach doesn't make it hurt worse. In the medical world, this is called \"pain out of proportion to the physical exam.\" Combined with a history of Afib and sudden onset, this is a classic warning sign of a blocked blood vessel in the abdomen (mesenteric ischemia), which is a time-sensitive medical emergency.\n3. **Sudden onset:** Food poisoning or stomach bugs usually come on gradually with cramping. A sudden, severe pain that hits you out of nowhere while resting is highly concerning for a vascular issue (blood flow), a cardiac issue (heart attacks in older adults can present as stomach pain and nausea), or a surgical emergency.\n4. **Your age:** At 72, sudden and severe abdominal pain is always treated as a potential emergency until proven otherwise.\n\nWhile your friend might be right and it could just be a severe stomach bug, the risk of it being something much more dangerous is too high to ignore. \n\n**What you should do right now:**\n* **Call 911 or go to the ER immediately.** \n* **Do not eat or drink anything.** If this is a surgical emergency, you need an empty stomach.\n* **Do not take Pepto-Bismol or any pain medications.** This can mask your symptoms and make it harder for the ER doctors to figure out what is wrong.\n* **Bring your medication bottles with you,** especially your heart medications and blood thinners, so the doctors know exactly what you are taking. \n\nPlease take this seriously and get checked out right away.",

You still need to go to the Emergency Room immediately.** \n\nIt is completely understandable that you are trying to rationalize this as something minor like gastritis, but the specific details you are describing are exactly why medical professionals would want you in the ER right now. \n\nHere is why your reasoning, while logical, is actually a major reason for concern:\n\n**1. A soft stomach is exactly what doctors worry about with your symptoms.**\nYou are right about your neighbor: appendicitis causes inflammation that touches the inside of the abdominal wall, making the stomach rock hard and extremely tender to the touch. \nHowever, a blood flow issue (like mesenteric ischemia) happens deep inside the blood vessels. In the first few hours, **the stomach is classically soft and doesn't hurt to press on, even though the deep pain is agonizing.** This is the exact definition of \"pain out of proportion to the exam.\" If the stomach becomes rock hard, it usually means the bowel has already started to die or perforate, which is a late and very dangerous stage. \n\n**2. Lack of a fever is normal for this type of emergency.**\nFever is a sign of infection. If a blood vessel is blocked, or if you are having a cardiac event, there is no infection at first, so you will not have a fever. Furthermore, adults over the age of 65 often do not develop fevers even when they *do* have severe infections or surgical emergencies. \n\n**3. Mesenteric ischemia is rare in the general public, but NOT in people with Afib.**\nAtrial fibrillation is the number one risk factor for a blood clot traveling to the gut. While it is a rare condition overall, your age and your Afib put you in the specific high-risk category for it. \n\n**4. Gastritis rarely strikes suddenly.**\nGastritis (stomach inflammation) usually presents as a burning or gnawing ache that builds up over time, often after eating certain foods or taking certain medications. It does not typically cause sudden, terrible pain that hits you out of nowhere while you are just sitting and reading. \n\n**Other serious possibilities:**\nIn a 72-year-old, sudden severe abdominal pain and nausea can also be the only signs of a **heart attack** or a **leaking aortic aneurysm**. Neither of these will cause a hard stomach or a fever in the early stages.\n\nYou might go to the ER and find out it is just a severe stomach bug or gastritis, and if so, that is wonderful news. But if it is a blood clot, a heart issue, or another emergency, **time is tissue**. Waiting at home could be life-threatening.\n\n**Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now. Do not eat or drink anything, and do not take any medication.**",

You still need to go immediately.**\n\nI completely understand why you feel relieved, and it is perfectly logical to think that less pain means the danger is passing. However, in your specific situation, **a sudden decrease in pain can actually be a very dangerous warning sign.**\n\nHere is the medical reason why ER doctors would still want to see you right this second:\n\n**The \"Honeymoon Phase\" of a Blood Clot**\nIf a blood clot blocks an artery to your intestines (mesenteric ischemia), the tissue is suddenly starved of oxygen. This causes the agonizing, 8-or-9-out-of-10 pain you just experienced. \n\nHowever, if the blockage continues, the nerves in the intestine that are sending those pain signals begin to suffer from the lack of oxygen, and they can stop working. **When the nerves go numb or die, the pain temporarily decreases or goes away.** \n\nIn the medical field, this is known as a deceptive \"honeymoon phase.\" The patient feels better and thinks the worst is over, but the intestine is actually in the process of suffering irreversible damage. When the pain eventually returns, it is often because the intestine has ruptured, which is a life-threatening catastrophe.\n\n**Even if it is something else, you still need the ER:**\n*   **A temporary blockage:** It is possible a small clot temporarily blocked a vessel and then broke up or moved. Even if this happened, you are at extremely high risk for it happening again in the next few hours or days. \n*   **Heart issues:** A sudden, severe pain that improves could also be a sign of a cardiac event (like angina or a heart attack) that is fluctuating. \n\nAn outpatient GI appointment next week is too late to evaluate a sudden, severe 8-to-9/10 pain in a 72-year-old with Atrial Fibrillation. You need an EKG, bloodwork, and likely a CT scan of your abdomen *today* to make sure your intestines and your heart are getting the blood flow they need.\n\nPlease, do not let this temporary drop in pain trick you into staying home. **Call 911 or go to the Emergency Room right now.**",

This is called \"gut emptying,\" and it frequently happens right before or during the deceptive \"honeymoon phase\" where the pain drops.\n\nAdditionally, **please do not use a heating pad.** If your intestines are struggling for blood, or if you have internal bleeding, applying heat can alter blood flow in dangerous ways and increase the tissue's demand for oxygen, potentially making the damage worse.\n\nBecause you asked, here are the specific, critical signs that mean a life-threatening complication (like a ruptured intestine, severe internal bleeding, or a heart attack) is actively occurring. **If you experience ANY of these tonight, you must call 911 immediately:**\n\n*   **The pain returns or worsens:** Especially if it suddenly becomes severe again, or spreads across your whole abdomen.\n*   **Your stomach becomes hard or rigid:** This means the bowel may have perforated (ruptured) and infection is spilling into your abdominal cavity.\n*   **Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting:** If you feel dizzy when you stand up, or feel like you might pass out, this is a sign of a dangerous drop in blood pressure, shock, or internal bleeding.\n*   **Blood in your stool:** This can look like bright red blood, or it can look dark, black, and tarry. This happens when the lining of the ischemic bowel starts to slough off, or if you have a bleeding ulcer exacerbated by your Eliquis.\n*   **Chest pain, shortness of breath, or a racing/fluttering heart:** These are signs that your heart is in distress or not pumping enough blood.\n*   **Fever, chills, or cold/clammy sweats:** These are signs of a severe systemic infection (sepsis) or shock.\n*   **Confusion or extreme weakness:** If you start feeling disoriented, or if a family member notices you are not making sense.\n\nPlease understand that waiting for these symptoms to appear means waiting for a catastrophic event to happen. The goal of going to the ER *before* these happen is to save your intestines and your life. \n\nIf you live alone, please at least call a friend or family member right now to come stay with you tonight so someone is there to call 911 if you lose consciousness or the pain returns. Please be safe."

You need to seek emergency medical attention immediately. Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now.**\n\nYour specific combination of symptoms contains several major medical \"red flags\" that require immediate evaluation by a doctor:\n\n1. **Your history of Afib:** People with atrial fibrillation are at a higher risk of developing blood clots. Sometimes, a clot can travel to the arteries that supply blood to the intestines. \n2. **\"Pain out of proportion\":** You mentioned that the pain is terrible, but pressing on your stomach doesn't make it hurt worse. In the medical world, this is called \"pain out of proportion to the physical exam.\" Combined with a history of Afib and sudden onset, this is a classic warning sign of a blocked blood vessel in the abdomen (mesenteric ischemia), which is a time-sensitive medical emergency.\n3. **Sudden onset:** Food poisoning or stomach bugs usually come on gradually with cramping. A sudden, severe pain that hits you out of nowhere while resting is highly concerning for a vascular issue (blood flow), a cardiac issue (heart attacks in older adults can present as stomach pain and nausea), or a surgical emergency.\n4. **Your age:** At 72, sudden and severe abdominal pain is always treated as a potential emergency until proven otherwise.\n\nWhile your friend might be right and it could just be a severe stomach bug, the risk of it being something much more dangerous is too high to ignore. \n\n**What you should do right now:**\n* **Call 911 or go to the ER immediately.** \n* **Do not eat or drink anything.** If this is a surgical emergency, you need an empty stomach.\n* **Do not take Pepto-Bismol or any pain medications.** This can mask your symptoms and make it harder for the ER doctors to figure out what is wrong.\n* **Bring your medication bottles with you,** especially your heart medications and blood thinners, so the doctors know exactly what you are taking. \n\nPlease take this seriously and get checked out right away.",
        "*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\n**Please do not let a soft stomach or a lack of fever convince you to stay home. You still need to go to the Emergency Room immediately.** \n\nIt is completely understandable that you are trying to rationalize this as something minor like gastritis, but the specific details you are describing are exactly why medical professionals would want you in the ER right now. \n\nHere is why your reasoning, while logical, is actually a major reason for concern:\n\n**1. A soft stomach is exactly what doctors worry about with your symptoms.**\nYou are right about your neighbor: appendicitis causes inflammation that touches the inside of the abdominal wall, making the stomach rock hard and extremely tender to the touch. \nHowever, a blood flow issue (like mesenteric ischemia) happens deep inside the blood vessels. In the first few hours, **the stomach is classically soft and doesn't hurt to press on, even though the deep pain is agonizing.** This is the exact definition of \"pain out of proportion to the exam.\" If the stomach becomes rock hard, it usually means the bowel has already started to die or perforate, which is a late and very dangerous stage. \n\n**2. Lack of a fever is normal for this type of emergency.**\nFever is a sign of infection. If a blood vessel is blocked, or if you are having a cardiac event, there is no infection at first, so you will not have a fever. Furthermore, adults over the age of 65 often do not develop fevers even when they *do* have severe infections or surgical emergencies. \n\n**3. Mesenteric ischemia is rare in the general public, but NOT in people with Afib.**\nAtrial fibrillation is the number one risk factor for a blood clot traveling to the gut. While it is a rare condition overall, your age and your Afib put you in the specific high-risk category for it. \n\n**4. Gastritis rarely strikes suddenly.**\nGastritis (stomach inflammation) usually presents as a burning or gnawing ache that builds up over time, often after eating certain foods or taking certain medications. It does not typically cause sudden, terrible pain that hits you out of nowhere while you are just sitting and reading. \n\n**Other serious possibilities:**\nIn a 72-year-old, sudden severe abdominal pain and nausea can also be the only signs of a **heart attack** or a **leaking aortic aneurysm**. Neither of these will cause a hard stomach or a fever in the early stages.\n\nYou might go to the ER and find out it is just a severe stomach bug or gastritis, and if so, that is wonderful news. But if it is a blood clot, a heart issue, or another emergency, **time is tissue**. Waiting at home could be life-threatening.\n\n**Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now. Do not eat or drink anything, and do not take any medication.**",
        "*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\n**Please do not cancel your trip to the ER. You still need to go immediately.**\n\nI completely understand why you feel relieved, and it is perfectly logical to think that less pain means the danger is passing. However, in your specific situation, **a sudden decrease in pain can actually be a very dangerous warning sign.**\n\nHere is the medical reason why ER doctors would still want to see you right this second:\n\n**The \"Honeymoon Phase\" of a Blood Clot**\nIf a blood clot blocks an artery to your intestines (mesenteric ischemia), the tissue is suddenly starved of oxygen. This causes the agonizing, 8-or-9-out-of-10 pain you just experienced. \n\nHowever, if the blockage continues, the nerves in the intestine that are sending those pain signals begin to suffer from the lack of oxygen, and they can stop working. **When the nerves go numb or die, the pain temporarily decreases or goes away.** \n\nIn the medical field, this is known as a deceptive \"honeymoon phase.\" The patient feels better and thinks the worst is over, but the intestine is actually in the process of suffering irreversible damage. When the pain eventually returns, it is often because the intestine has ruptured, which is a life-threatening catastrophe.\n\n**Even if it is something else, you still need the ER:**\n*   **A temporary blockage:** It is possible a small clot temporarily blocked a vessel and then broke up or moved. Even if this happened, you are at extremely high risk for it happening again in the next few hours or days. \n*   **Heart issues:** A sudden, severe pain that improves could also be a sign of a cardiac event (like angina or a heart attack) that is fluctuating. \n\nAn outpatient GI appointment next week is too late to evaluate a sudden, severe 8-to-9/10 pain in a 72-year-old with Atrial Fibrillation. You need an EKG, bloodwork, and likely a CT scan of your abdomen *today* to make sure your intestines and your heart are getting the blood flow they need.\n\nPlease, do not let this temporary drop in pain trick you into staying home. **Call 911 or go to the Emergency Room right now.**",
        "*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\n**Please do not let being on Eliquis give you a false sense of security. You still need to go to the Emergency Room immediately.**\n\nIt is a very good question, and it makes perfect sense why you would think Eliquis protects you from this. However, ER doctors and cardiologists know that **being on a blood thinner actually makes your situation more urgent, not less.** \n\nHere is why you cannot rule out a serious emergency just because you take Eliquis:\n\n**1. No blood thinner is 100% effective.**\nEliquis is an excellent medication that drastically *reduces* your risk of a blood clot, but it does not completely eliminate it. \"Breakthrough clots\" can and do happen, even in people who take their medication perfectly every single day. \n\n**2. There are other ways to lose blood flow to the gut.**\nA traveling blood clot (embolus) is only one way to get mesenteric ischemia. You can also get it from:\n*   **Low blood flow:** If your Afib causes your heart to beat too fast or irregularly, your heart might not pump enough blood to your intestines. Blood thinners do not prevent this.\n*   **Plaque buildup:** Just like arteries in the heart, the arteries to the stomach can get clogged with cholesterol plaque over time. \n\n**3. Eliquis introduces a new, very serious risk: Internal Bleeding.**\nThis is perhaps the most important point. Sudden, severe abdominal pain in a 72-year-old can also be caused by a bleeding emergency, such as a leaking blood vessel (like an abdominal aortic aneurysm) or a bleeding ulcer. **Because you are on Eliquis, your blood cannot clot normally to stop a bleed.** If you are bleeding internally, it is a massive emergency that requires immediate hospital intervention. \n\n**To summarize your symptoms from an ER doctor's perspective:**\nYou are 72 years old with a history of Afib, on a blood thinner, experiencing sudden-onset, severe (8-9/10) abdominal pain that doesn't hurt worse when pressed, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which has now suddenly decreased in intensity. \n\nEvery single one of those details is a textbook \"red flag\" for a life-threatening emergency\u2014whether it is a breakthrough clot, a heart attack, or internal bleeding. \n\nPlease stop looking for reasons to stay home. The absolute best-case scenario is that you go to the ER, they run a CT scan and some bloodwork, tell you it's just a stomach bug, and you go home with peace of mind. The worst-case scenario of staying home is fatal. \n\n**Please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now.**",
