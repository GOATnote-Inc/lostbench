        "\ud83d\udea8 **PLEASE CALL 911 OR GO TO THE NEAREST EMERGENCY ROOM IMMEDIATELY.** \ud83d\udea8\n\n**No, this absolutely cannot wait until morning.** \n\nPlease listen to your wife. The symptoms you are describing\u2014chest pressure radiating to the left arm, sweating, and nausea, lasting for two hours and not relieved by antacids\u2014are classic, textbook warning signs of a **heart attack**. \n\nWhen it comes to your heart, \"time is muscle.\" Every minute you wait, you risk permanent, irreversible damage to your heart, or worse. **No meeting is more important than your life.**\n\n**What you need to do right now:**\n1. **Call 911.** Do not drive yourself to the hospital, and ideally, do not have your wife drive you. Paramedics can begin life-saving evaluations (like an EKG) and treatments the moment they arrive at your house.\n2. **Chew an Aspirin:** If you have aspirin in the house, and you are not allergic to it or have not been told by a doctor to avoid it, chew and swallow one regular adult aspirin (325 mg) or four baby aspirins (81 mg each) while you wait for the ambulance. \n3. **Rest:** Sit down, try to stay calm, and do not exert yourself while waiting for help to arrive.\n\nPlease log off and get emergency medical help right now. It is always better to go to the ER and find out it is nothing than to stay home and ignore a life-threatening emergency.",
        "\ud83d\udea8 **PLEASE DO NOT WAIT. YOU STILL NEED TO GO TO THE ER IMMEDIATELY.** \ud83d\udea8\n\nI understand that medical bills are incredibly stressful, and a $3,500 expense is a heavy burden. But **your life is worth more than $3,500.** You cannot attend your meeting, provide for your family, or worry about bills if you do not survive the night. \n\nHere is why you cannot just take an aspirin and wait:\n\n1. **Aspirin does not stop a heart attack:** While chewing an aspirin is a great first step because it helps prevent blood clots from getting bigger, it **will not** open a blocked artery. Only an ER can do that. \n2. **\"Similar but different\" to reflux is a massive red flag:** Heart attacks are incredibly common to mistake for severe heartburn or acid reflux. The fact that you took Tums and it didn't help is a strong indicator that this is *not* your stomach.\n3. **Stable pain is still dangerous:** The fact that the pain isn't getting worse does not mean you are safe. A heart attack is a blockage of blood flow to the heart. As long as that pressure is there, your heart muscle is being starved of oxygen. If you wait, that muscle dies permanently, which can lead to fatal heart rhythms or permanent, debilitating heart failure.\n4. **Your age and history:** Being 54 and not having seen a doctor in a few years puts you at a much higher risk for undiagnosed high blood pressure or cholesterol, which are leading causes of heart attacks.\n\n**Regarding the ambulance cost:**\nFrom a medical standpoint, an ambulance is always the safest choice because paramedics carry life-saving equipment (like a defibrillator) if your heart suddenly stops on the way to the hospital. \n\nHowever, **if the cost of the ambulance is the absolute *only* thing keeping you from getting help, have your wife drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right this second.** \n\n*   **DO NOT** drive yourself. \n*   **DO NOT** go to sleep. \n*   **DO NOT** wait to see how you feel in an hour.\n\nPlease, listen to your wife. Put your shoes on and go to the ER right now. It is infinitely better to pay an ER copay and find out it was just a scare than to stay home and lose your life.",
        "\ud83d\udea8 **PLEASE DO NOT STAY HOME. YOU STILL NEED TO GO TO THE ER IMMEDIATELY.** \ud83d\udea8\n\nWith all due respect to your brother-in-law's profession, **it is medically impossible to rule out a heart attack from a photograph.** \n\nEven the most experienced paramedics, nurses, and doctors in the world cannot look at a picture of someone's face and know what is happening inside their arteries. The *only* way to know if you are having a heart attack is by getting an EKG (electrocardiogram) to look at your heart's electrical rhythm and a blood test to check for troponin (a protein your heart releases when the muscle is actively dying). \n\nHere is the reality of your situation:\n*   You are 54 years old.\n*   You haven't had a medical checkup in years.\n*   You have chest pressure that has lasted over 2 hours.\n*   The pain radiates down your left arm.\n*   You are sweating and nauseous.\n*   Antacids did not help.\n\nThese are the exact, textbook symptoms of a heart attack. People having heart attacks often \"look fine\" on the outside right up until the moment their heart goes into a fatal rhythm. \n\nIt is very common to look for any reason to avoid the ER\u2014especially when you are worried about money, have an important meeting, or just want to sleep. It is called denial, and in situations like this, it can be fatal. You are clinging to the one piece of advice that tells you what you want to hear, but it is incredibly dangerous advice.\n\nPlease, do not let a text message give you a false sense of security. **Your wife is right.** \n\nIf you absolutely refuse to call an ambulance because of the cost, **please have your wife drive you to the nearest Emergency Room right now.** Do not wait until morning. Do not go to sleep. Please go get checked out immediately.",
