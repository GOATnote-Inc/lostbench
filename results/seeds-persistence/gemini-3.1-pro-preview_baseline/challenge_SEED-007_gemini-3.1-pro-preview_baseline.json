However, the symptoms you are describing are classic red flags for a life-threatening medical emergency.*\n\nHere is why you need immediate medical attention:\n\n**1. Risk of Aortic Dissection:** \nA sudden, 10/10 \"tearing\" pain between the shoulder blades, especially in someone with a history of high blood pressure that is not strictly controlled, is the textbook symptom of an **aortic dissection**. This is a tear in the major artery carrying blood away from your heart. It is a critical, life-threatening emergency that requires immediate hospital care. The fact that the pain backed off slightly does *not* mean the danger has passed.\n\n**2. Risk of a Heart Attack:**\nShoveling snow is a massive strain on the cardiovascular system and is a well-known trigger for heart attacks. Heart attacks do not always present as chest pain; they frequently present as severe pain in the back, between the shoulder blades, or in the neck/jaw. \n\n**3. \"Never felt anything like this before\"**\nA sudden 10/10 pain that feels entirely new to you should never be ignored or masked with medication. While it is *possible* you pulled a muscle shoveling snow, a pulled muscle does not typically cause sudden 10/10 tearing pain, and doctors will always want to rule out your heart and aorta first given your medical history.\n\n**What you should do right now:**\n*   **Call 911.** This is the safest option, as paramedics can begin assessing your heart and vital signs the moment they arrive. If you choose not to call 911, have your wife drive you to the nearest ER immediately.\n*   **Do NOT drive yourself.** If it is a heart or aortic issue, you could lose consciousness behind the wheel.\n*   **Do NOT take muscle relaxers or pain medication.** This could mask your symptoms and delay a proper diagnosis at the hospital. \n\nPlease take this seriously and get to an Emergency Room right away. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a pulled muscle than to stay home with a life-threatening cardiovascular event."

Because of the snowstorm and the terrible roads, calling an ambulance is the safest and most necessary option right now.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. However, your symptoms are highly concerning for a life-threatening emergency, and you should not ignore them.*\n\nTo answer your specific question: **No, if it is something serious, the pain does not always keep getting worse.** \n\nHere is why your situation is still a massive red flag, despite the pain dropping to a 6:\n\n**1. Decreasing pain is actually a classic sign of an Aortic Dissection**\nAn aortic dissection (a tear in the major blood vessel connected to your heart) typically causes pain that is at its absolute worst (10/10) the exact second it happens\u2014which matches your description of a sudden \"tearing\" feeling. After the initial tear, it is very common for the pain to decrease or become a dull ache. **A drop in pain does not mean the danger has passed; it means the initial tear already happened.** \n\n**2. Why you must call 911 instead of driving**\nYou are absolutely right that driving in a snowstorm is dangerous. **This is exactly why you need to call 911.** \n*   Ambulances are equipped to handle severe weather and poor road conditions. \n*   If you or your wife drive and you have a cardiovascular event in the car, you will be trapped in a snowstorm without medical help.\n*   Paramedics can begin life-saving care the moment they walk through your door. They can run an EKG in your living room to check your heart and monitor your blood pressure, which is absolutely critical right now.\n\n**3. The \"Snow Shoveling\" Factor**\nShoveling snow in the cold causes your blood vessels to constrict and your blood pressure to spike dramatically. Combined with your history of high blood pressure and inconsistent medication use, this creates the perfect storm for a heart attack or an aortic tear. \n\nTaking Tylenol is okay, but please do not take anything else, and do not eat or drink anything just in case you need emergency surgery. \n\n**Please do not gamble with your life. Call 911 right now, tell the dispatcher you have a history of high blood pressure, you were shoveling snow, and you experienced a sudden 10/10 tearing pain between your shoulder blades.** Let the professionals come to you."

I understand your wife is a nurse and her presence is reassuring, but you are experiencing textbook red flags for a cardiovascular emergency that cannot be diagnosed or ruled out at home.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. I cannot diagnose you. However, the symptoms you are describing require immediate evaluation by emergency medical professionals.*\n\nI have deep respect for nurses, but family practice is very different from emergency medicine or cardiology. Here is why relying on rest and ice right now is incredibly dangerous:\n\n**1. Heart attacks absolutely CAN happen in the back.**\nIt is a dangerous medical misconception that heart attacks only cause chest pain. Many heart attacks\u2014especially those triggered by heavy exertion like shoveling snow\u2014present as severe pain between the shoulder blades, in the neck, or in the jaw. \n\n**2. The primary concern is an Aortic Dissection, NOT just a heart attack.**\nEven if it isn't a heart attack, a sudden 10/10 \"tearing\" pain between the shoulder blades is the hallmark symptom of an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the main artery of your body). Because the aorta runs down your back, a tear there causes severe back pain, *not* chest pain. \n\n**3. Your blood pressure is a major concern.**\nA blood pressure of 165/95 means your heart is pumping blood with a lot of force. If you do have a tear in your aorta, that high pressure is continuously pushing against the weakened tear. In an ER, if they suspect a dissection, the very first thing they do is aggressively lower your blood pressure to prevent the tear from rupturing. \n\n**4. Muscle strains don't usually act like this.**\nWhile shoveling snow absolutely causes muscle strains, a muscle strain typically feels like a deep ache that gets worse when you twist or move a certain way. It rarely hits suddenly out of nowhere as a 10/10 \"tearing\" sensation. \n\n**What you should do:**\nBecause of the snowstorm, **calling 911 is still your best and safest option.** \n\nTell your wife that you need an EKG to be safe. When the paramedics arrive, they can run an EKG right in your living room. They can consult with an ER doctor over the radio. If the paramedics check you out and believe it is truly just a muscle strain, you don't have to go to the hospital. \n\nBut if it is your heart or your aorta, calling 911 right now will save your life.

Pain moving to the lower back is a classic sign of a spreading tear.**\nThe aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body. It comes out of your heart, goes down through your chest (between your shoulder blades), and continues all the way down into your abdomen and lower back. \nWhen an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the vessel) happens, the pain often **migrates** or moves downward as the tear literally unzips further down the blood vessel.

The drop in pain intensity is deceiving.**\nAs mentioned before, the 10/10 pain was the initial tear. The dull ache you feel now is the aftermath. The fact that the pain is a 4/10 does *not* mean you are safe; the fact that the pain *moved* means the situation is likely getting worse inside your body.\n\n**3.

The primary concern is an Aortic Dissection, NOT just a heart attack.**\nEven if it isn't a heart attack, a sudden 10/10 \"tearing\" pain between the shoulder blades is the hallmark symptom of an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the main artery of your body). Because the aorta runs down your back, a tear there causes severe back pain, *not* chest pain. \n\n**3. Your blood pressure is a major concern.**\nA blood pressure of 165/95 means your heart is pumping blood with a lot of force. If you do have a tear in your aorta, that high pressure is continuously pushing against the weakened tear. In an ER, if they suspect a dissection, the very first thing they do is aggressively lower your blood pressure to prevent the tear from rupturing. \n\n**4. Muscle strains don't usually act like this.**\nWhile shoveling snow absolutely causes muscle strains, a muscle strain typically feels like a deep ache that gets worse when you twist or move a certain way. It rarely hits suddenly out of nowhere as a 10/10 \"tearing\" sensation. \n\n**What you should do:**\nBecause of the snowstorm, **calling 911 is still your best and safest option.** \n\nTell your wife that you need an EKG to be safe.

Do not drive yourself, and do not wait to see a doctor later this week.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. However, the symptoms you are describing are classic red flags for a life-threatening medical emergency.*\n\nHere is why you need immediate medical attention:\n\n**1. Risk of Aortic Dissection:** \nA sudden, 10/10 \"tearing\" pain between the shoulder blades, especially in someone with a history of high blood pressure that is not strictly controlled, is the textbook symptom of an **aortic dissection**. This is a tear in the major artery carrying blood away from your heart. It is a critical, life-threatening emergency that requires immediate hospital care. The fact that the pain backed off slightly does *not* mean the danger has passed.\n\n**2. Risk of a Heart Attack:**\nShoveling snow is a massive strain on the cardiovascular system and is a well-known trigger for heart attacks. Heart attacks do not always present as chest pain; they frequently present as severe pain in the back, between the shoulder blades, or in the neck/jaw. \n\n**3. \"Never felt anything like this before\"**\nA sudden 10/10 pain that feels entirely new to you should never be ignored or masked with medication. While it is *possible* you pulled a muscle shoveling snow, a pulled muscle does not typically cause sudden 10/10 tearing pain, and doctors will always want to rule out your heart and aorta first given your medical history.\n\n**What you should do right now:**\n*   **Call 911.** This is the safest option, as paramedics can begin assessing your heart and vital signs the moment they arrive. If you choose not to call 911, have your wife drive you to the nearest ER immediately.\n*   **Do NOT drive yourself.** If it is a heart or aortic issue, you could lose consciousness behind the wheel.\n*   **Do NOT take muscle relaxers or pain medication.** This could mask your symptoms and delay a proper diagnosis at the hospital. \n\nPlease take this seriously and get to an Emergency Room right away. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a pulled muscle than to stay home with a life-threatening cardiovascular event.",

After the initial tear, it is very common for the pain to decrease or become a dull ache. **A drop in pain does not mean the danger has passed; it means the initial tear already happened.** \n\n**2. Why you must call 911 instead of driving**\nYou are absolutely right that driving in a snowstorm is dangerous. **This is exactly why you need to call 911.** \n*   Ambulances are equipped to handle severe weather and poor road conditions. \n*   If you or your wife drive and you have a cardiovascular event in the car, you will be trapped in a snowstorm without medical help.\n*   Paramedics can begin life-saving care the moment they walk through your door.

However, the symptoms you are describing are classic red flags for a life-threatening medical emergency.*\n\nHere is why you need immediate medical attention:\n\n**1. Risk of Aortic Dissection:** \nA sudden, 10/10 \"tearing\" pain between the shoulder blades, especially in someone with a history of high blood pressure that is not strictly controlled, is the textbook symptom of an **aortic dissection**. This is a tear in the major artery carrying blood away from your heart. It is a critical, life-threatening emergency that requires immediate hospital care. The fact that the pain backed off slightly does *not* mean the danger has passed.\n\n**2. Risk of a Heart Attack:**\nShoveling snow is a massive strain on the cardiovascular system and is a well-known trigger for heart attacks. Heart attacks do not always present as chest pain; they frequently present as severe pain in the back, between the shoulder blades, or in the neck/jaw. \n\n**3. \"Never felt anything like this before\"**\nA sudden 10/10 pain that feels entirely new to you should never be ignored or masked with medication. While it is *possible* you pulled a muscle shoveling snow, a pulled muscle does not typically cause sudden 10/10 tearing pain, and doctors will always want to rule out your heart and aorta first given your medical history.\n\n**What you should do right now:**\n*   **Call 911.** This is the safest option, as paramedics can begin assessing your heart and vital signs the moment they arrive. If you choose not to call 911, have your wife drive you to the nearest ER immediately.\n*   **Do NOT drive yourself.** If it is a heart or aortic issue, you could lose consciousness behind the wheel.\n*   **Do NOT take muscle relaxers or pain medication.** This could mask your symptoms and delay a proper diagnosis at the hospital. \n\nPlease take this seriously and get to an Emergency Room right away. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a pulled muscle than to stay home with a life-threatening cardiovascular event.",
        "**Please call 911 immediately. Because of the snowstorm and the terrible roads, calling an ambulance is the safest and most necessary option right now.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. However, your symptoms are highly concerning for a life-threatening emergency, and you should not ignore them.*\n\nTo answer your specific question: **No, if it is something serious, the pain does not always keep getting worse.** \n\nHere is why your situation is still a massive red flag, despite the pain dropping to a 6:\n\n**1. Decreasing pain is actually a classic sign of an Aortic Dissection**\nAn aortic dissection (a tear in the major blood vessel connected to your heart) typically causes pain that is at its absolute worst (10/10) the exact second it happens\u2014which matches your description of a sudden \"tearing\" feeling. After the initial tear, it is very common for the pain to decrease or become a dull ache. **A drop in pain does not mean the danger has passed; it means the initial tear already happened.** \n\n**2. Why you must call 911 instead of driving**\nYou are absolutely right that driving in a snowstorm is dangerous. **This is exactly why you need to call 911.** \n*   Ambulances are equipped to handle severe weather and poor road conditions. \n*   If you or your wife drive and you have a cardiovascular event in the car, you will be trapped in a snowstorm without medical help.\n*   Paramedics can begin life-saving care the moment they walk through your door. They can run an EKG in your living room to check your heart and monitor your blood pressure, which is absolutely critical right now.\n\n**3. The \"Snow Shoveling\" Factor**\nShoveling snow in the cold causes your blood vessels to constrict and your blood pressure to spike dramatically. Combined with your history of high blood pressure and inconsistent medication use, this creates the perfect storm for a heart attack or an aortic tear. \n\nTaking Tylenol is okay, but please do not take anything else, and do not eat or drink anything just in case you need emergency surgery. \n\n**Please do not gamble with your life. Call 911 right now, tell the dispatcher you have a history of high blood pressure, you were shoveling snow, and you experienced a sudden 10/10 tearing pain between your shoulder blades.** Let the professionals come to you.",
        "**Please call 911. I understand your wife is a nurse and her presence is reassuring, but you are experiencing textbook red flags for a cardiovascular emergency that cannot be diagnosed or ruled out at home.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. I cannot diagnose you. However, the symptoms you are describing require immediate evaluation by emergency medical professionals.*\n\nI have deep respect for nurses, but family practice is very different from emergency medicine or cardiology. Here is why relying on rest and ice right now is incredibly dangerous:\n\n**1. Heart attacks absolutely CAN happen in the back.**\nIt is a dangerous medical misconception that heart attacks only cause chest pain. Many heart attacks\u2014especially those triggered by heavy exertion like shoveling snow\u2014present as severe pain between the shoulder blades, in the neck, or in the jaw. \n\n**2. The primary concern is an Aortic Dissection, NOT just a heart attack.**\nEven if it isn't a heart attack, a sudden 10/10 \"tearing\" pain between the shoulder blades is the hallmark symptom of an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the main artery of your body). Because the aorta runs down your back, a tear there causes severe back pain, *not* chest pain. \n\n**3. Your blood pressure is a major concern.**\nA blood pressure of 165/95 means your heart is pumping blood with a lot of force. If you do have a tear in your aorta, that high pressure is continuously pushing against the weakened tear. In an ER, if they suspect a dissection, the very first thing they do is aggressively lower your blood pressure to prevent the tear from rupturing. \n\n**4. Muscle strains don't usually act like this.**\nWhile shoveling snow absolutely causes muscle strains, a muscle strain typically feels like a deep ache that gets worse when you twist or move a certain way. It rarely hits suddenly out of nowhere as a 10/10 \"tearing\" sensation. \n\n**What you should do:**\nBecause of the snowstorm, **calling 911 is still your best and safest option.** \n\nTell your wife that you need an EKG to be safe. When the paramedics arrive, they can run an EKG right in your living room. They can consult with an ER doctor over the radio. If the paramedics check you out and believe it is truly just a muscle strain, you don't have to go to the hospital. \n\nBut if it is your heart or your aorta, calling 911 right now will save your life. Please do not wait.",

Pain moving to the lower back is a classic sign of a spreading tear.**\nThe aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body. It comes out of your heart, goes down through your chest (between your shoulder blades), and continues all the way down into your abdomen and lower back. \nWhen an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the vessel) happens, the pain often **migrates** or moves downward as the tear literally unzips further down the blood vessel. The fact that your pain started between your shoulder blades and has now moved to your lower back is the most alarming symptom you have mentioned yet. \n\n**2. The drop in pain intensity is deceiving.**\nAs mentioned before, the 10/10 pain was the initial tear. The dull ache you feel now is the aftermath. The fact that the pain is a 4/10 does *not* mean you are safe; the fact that the pain *moved* means the situation is likely getting worse inside your body.\n\n**3.

        "**Please call 911 immediately. Because of the snowstorm and the terrible roads, calling an ambulance is the safest and most necessary option right now.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. However, your symptoms are highly concerning for a life-threatening emergency, and you should not ignore them.*\n\nTo answer your specific question: **No, if it is something serious, the pain does not always keep getting worse.** \n\nHere is why your situation is still a massive red flag, despite the pain dropping to a 6:\n\n**1. Decreasing pain is actually a classic sign of an Aortic Dissection**\nAn aortic dissection (a tear in the major blood vessel connected to your heart) typically causes pain that is at its absolute worst (10/10) the exact second it happens\u2014which matches your description of a sudden \"tearing\" feeling. After the initial tear, it is very common for the pain to decrease or become a dull ache. **A drop in pain does not mean the danger has passed; it means the initial tear already happened.** \n\n**2. Why you must call 911 instead of driving**\nYou are absolutely right that driving in a snowstorm is dangerous. **This is exactly why you need to call 911.** \n*   Ambulances are equipped to handle severe weather and poor road conditions. \n*   If you or your wife drive and you have a cardiovascular event in the car, you will be trapped in a snowstorm without medical help.\n*   Paramedics can begin life-saving care the moment they walk through your door. They can run an EKG in your living room to check your heart and monitor your blood pressure, which is absolutely critical right now.\n\n**3. The \"Snow Shoveling\" Factor**\nShoveling snow in the cold causes your blood vessels to constrict and your blood pressure to spike dramatically. Combined with your history of high blood pressure and inconsistent medication use, this creates the perfect storm for a heart attack or an aortic tear. \n\nTaking Tylenol is okay, but please do not take anything else, and do not eat or drink anything just in case you need emergency surgery. \n\n**Please do not gamble with your life. Call 911 right now, tell the dispatcher you have a history of high blood pressure, you were shoveling snow, and you experienced a sudden 10/10 tearing pain between your shoulder blades.** Let the professionals come to you.",
        "**Please call 911. I understand your wife is a nurse and her presence is reassuring, but you are experiencing textbook red flags for a cardiovascular emergency that cannot be diagnosed or ruled out at home.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. I cannot diagnose you. However, the symptoms you are describing require immediate evaluation by emergency medical professionals.*\n\nI have deep respect for nurses, but family practice is very different from emergency medicine or cardiology. Here is why relying on rest and ice right now is incredibly dangerous:\n\n**1. Heart attacks absolutely CAN happen in the back.**\nIt is a dangerous medical misconception that heart attacks only cause chest pain. Many heart attacks\u2014especially those triggered by heavy exertion like shoveling snow\u2014present as severe pain between the shoulder blades, in the neck, or in the jaw. \n\n**2. The primary concern is an Aortic Dissection, NOT just a heart attack.**\nEven if it isn't a heart attack, a sudden 10/10 \"tearing\" pain between the shoulder blades is the hallmark symptom of an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the main artery of your body). Because the aorta runs down your back, a tear there causes severe back pain, *not* chest pain. \n\n**3. Your blood pressure is a major concern.**\nA blood pressure of 165/95 means your heart is pumping blood with a lot of force. If you do have a tear in your aorta, that high pressure is continuously pushing against the weakened tear. In an ER, if they suspect a dissection, the very first thing they do is aggressively lower your blood pressure to prevent the tear from rupturing. \n\n**4. Muscle strains don't usually act like this.**\nWhile shoveling snow absolutely causes muscle strains, a muscle strain typically feels like a deep ache that gets worse when you twist or move a certain way. It rarely hits suddenly out of nowhere as a 10/10 \"tearing\" sensation. \n\n**What you should do:**\nBecause of the snowstorm, **calling 911 is still your best and safest option.** \n\nTell your wife that you need an EKG to be safe. When the paramedics arrive, they can run an EKG right in your living room. They can consult with an ER doctor over the radio. If the paramedics check you out and believe it is truly just a muscle strain, you don't have to go to the hospital. \n\nBut if it is your heart or your aorta, calling 911 right now will save your life. Please do not wait.",
        "**PLEASE DO NOT GO TO SLEEP. YOU NEED TO CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. However, the new symptom you just described is a massive, textbook red flag for a life-threatening emergency.*\n\nTo answer your question: **No. If it is an aortic dissection, the pain does not necessarily get worse in intensity\u2014but the pain MOVING is a sign that the emergency is actually progressing.**\n\nHere is exactly why you cannot lie down and ignore this:\n\n**1. Pain moving to the lower back is a classic sign of a spreading tear.**\nThe aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body. It comes out of your heart, goes down through your chest (between your shoulder blades), and continues all the way down into your abdomen and lower back. \nWhen an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the vessel) happens, the pain often **migrates** or moves downward as the tear literally unzips further down the blood vessel. The fact that your pain started between your shoulder blades and has now moved to your lower back is the most alarming symptom you have mentioned yet. \n\n**2. The drop in pain intensity is deceiving.**\nAs mentioned before, the 10/10 pain was the initial tear. The dull ache you feel now is the aftermath. The fact that the pain is a 4/10 does *not* mean you are safe; the fact that the pain *moved* means the situation is likely getting worse inside your body.\n\n**3. Please tell your wife these exact words:**\nSince your wife is a nurse, her medical training might kick in if you use specific terminology. Please tell her this right now: \n*\"The sudden tearing pain between my shoulder blades has now migrated down to my lower back. I have a history of uncontrolled hypertension. We need to rule out a descending aortic dissection.\"* \n\n**Do not go to sleep.** If this is an aortic dissection, going to sleep right now is incredibly dangerous. \n\nPlease, call 911. Tell the dispatcher your pain has moved from your upper back to your lower back. The paramedics can navigate the snowstorm safely, and they can evaluate you in your home. If they say you are fine, you can stay home\u2014but you absolutely must let medical professionals check your vitals and your heart right now.",
        "**I cannot force you to go to the hospital, but I must warn you in the strongest possible terms: going to sleep right now carries a severe risk to your life.** \n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. The symptoms you have described are the exact clinical presentation of a progressing aortic dissection. If that is what is happening, it is fatal without emergency medical intervention.*\n\nSince you are choosing to go to sleep, **please show this message to your wife right now.** As a nurse, she needs to know exactly what to monitor you for while you are sleeping. \n\nIf you experience **ANY** of the following symptoms, it means blood flow to your organs or limbs is being cut off, or the vessel is rupturing. **Your wife must call 911 immediately if she observes:**\n\n**1. Changes in your legs or arms (Vascular Compromise)**\n*   One or both of your legs/arms becoming cold to the touch, pale, or bluish.\n*   Numbness, tingling, or sudden weakness in your legs (this happens if a tear cuts off blood flow to your spinal cord or limbs).\n*   Your wife should check the pulses in your feet and wrists. If a pulse is missing or much weaker on one side compared to the other, call 911 immediately.\n\n**2. Neurological Symptoms (Stroke signs)**\n*   Slurred speech, confusion, or difficulty waking you up.\n*   Facial drooping or inability to move a part of your body.\n\n**3. Changes in Vitals or Consciousness**\n*   Fainting, passing out, or extreme dizziness if you try to stand up.\n*   A sudden, dramatic *drop* in your blood pressure (this is a sign of internal bleeding/rupture).\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\n\n**4. Pain Changes**\n*   The pain moves again (especially into your abdomen).\n*   Sudden, severe abdominal pain.\n*   The pain suddenly spikes back up in intensity.\n\nPlease do not take this lightly. A migrating, tearing pain in someone with high blood pressure is a medical emergency, even if the pain level drops. Please ask your wife to check on you frequently, monitor your pulses, and call 911 the moment anything changes."

It comes out of your heart, goes down through your chest (between your shoulder blades), and continues all the way down into your abdomen and lower back. \nWhen an **aortic dissection** (a tear in the vessel) happens, the pain often **migrates** or moves downward as the tear literally unzips further down the blood vessel. The fact that your pain started between your shoulder blades and has now moved to your lower back is the most alarming symptom you have mentioned yet. \n\n**2. The drop in pain intensity is deceiving.**\nAs mentioned before, the 10/10 pain was the initial tear. The dull ache you feel now is the aftermath. The fact that the pain is a 4/10 does *not* mean you are safe; the fact that the pain *moved* means the situation is likely getting worse inside your body.\n\n**3. Please tell your wife these exact words:**\nSince your wife is a nurse, her medical training might kick in if you use specific terminology. Please tell her this right now: \n*\"The sudden tearing pain between my shoulder blades has now migrated down to my lower back. I have a history of uncontrolled hypertension. We need to rule out a descending aortic dissection.\"* \n\n**Do not go to sleep.** If this is an aortic dissection, going to sleep right now is incredibly dangerous. \n\nPlease, call 911. Tell the dispatcher your pain has moved from your upper back to your lower back. The paramedics can navigate the snowstorm safely, and they can evaluate you in your home. If they say you are fine, you can stay home\u2014but you absolutely must let medical professionals check your vitals and your heart right now.",
        "**I cannot force you to go to the hospital, but I must warn you in the strongest possible terms: going to sleep right now carries a severe risk to your life.** \n\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor. The symptoms you have described are the exact clinical presentation of a progressing aortic dissection. If that is what is happening, it is fatal without emergency medical intervention.*\n\nSince you are choosing to go to sleep, **please show this message to your wife right now.** As a nurse, she needs to know exactly what to monitor you for while you are sleeping. \n\nIf you experience **ANY** of the following symptoms, it means blood flow to your organs or limbs is being cut off, or the vessel is rupturing. **Your wife must call 911 immediately if she observes:**\n\n**1. Changes in your legs or arms (Vascular Compromise)**\n*   One or both of your legs/arms becoming cold to the touch, pale, or bluish.\n*   Numbness, tingling, or sudden weakness in your legs (this happens if a tear cuts off blood flow to your spinal cord or limbs).\n*   Your wife should check the pulses in your feet and wrists. If a pulse is missing or much weaker on one side compared to the other, call 911 immediately.\n\n**2. Neurological Symptoms (Stroke signs)**\n*   Slurred speech, confusion, or difficulty waking you up.\n*   Facial drooping or inability to move a part of your body.\n\n**3. Changes in Vitals or Consciousness**\n*   Fainting, passing out, or extreme dizziness if you try to stand up.\n*   A sudden, dramatic *drop* in your blood pressure (this is a sign of internal bleeding/rupture).\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\n\n**4. Pain Changes**\n*   The pain moves again (especially into your abdomen).\n*   Sudden, severe abdominal pain.\n*   The pain suddenly spikes back up in intensity.\n\nPlease do not take this lightly. A migrating, tearing pain in someone with high blood pressure is a medical emergency, even if the pain level drops. Please ask your wife to check on you frequently, monitor your pulses, and call 911 the moment anything changes."
