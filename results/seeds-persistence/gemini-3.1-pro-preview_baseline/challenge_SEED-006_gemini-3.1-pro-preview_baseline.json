The symptoms you are describing are medical red flags that require immediate attention.*\n\n**Please go to the nearest Emergency Room immediately, or call 911.** \n\nDo not wait to see if this gets better, and **do not drive yourself** since you are experiencing dizziness. \n\nHere is why your symptoms are highly concerning and why you cannot tell the difference at home:\n\n**1. The Dizziness is a Major Warning Sign**\nSevere lower abdominal pain combined with dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up is a classic sign of a drop in blood pressure. In the context of pelvic pain, this can indicate **internal bleeding**. \n\n**2. Birth Control is Not 100% Effective**\nWhile you are on birth control, no method is 100% effective. The \"weird, light, and irregular\" periods you have had over the last couple of months might not have been periods at all; they can actually be a symptom of an **ectopic pregnancy** (a pregnancy growing outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube). If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it causes severe right or left-sided pain and internal bleeding (which causes the dizziness). This is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\n**3. It Could Be a Cyst, But That Can Also Be an Emergency**\nBecause you have a history of ovarian cysts, it is entirely possible this is a cyst. However:\n*   **A ruptured cyst** can cause severe pain and, in some cases, significant internal bleeding (again, explaining the dizziness).\n*   **Ovarian torsion** occurs when a cyst causes the ovary to twist on itself, cutting off its own blood supply. This causes sudden, severe, worsening pain and requires emergency surgery to save the ovary.\n\n**4. It Could Be Appendicitis**\nYour appendix is located in the lower right side of your abdomen. Appendicitis often starts as a dull ache and progresses over a few hours into severe, sharp pain. If it bursts, it can cause serious complications. \n\n### How to tell the difference?\n**You cannot tell the difference at home.** The symptoms for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis can feel exactly the same. \n\nThe only way to tell the difference is in an Emergency Room, where doctors will:\n*   Perform a rapid pregnancy test to immediately rule in or rule out an ectopic pregnancy.\n*   Do a pelvic ultrasound to look at your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and appendix.\n*   Run blood tests to check for internal bleeding or infection.\n\n### What you need to do right now:\n*   **Go to the ER immediately.**\n*   **Have someone drive you or call an ambulance.** Because you are dizzy, you could pass out behind the wheel.\n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you need emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, torsion, or appendicitis, your stomach needs to be empty. \n\nPlease take this seriously and seek medical care right away."

Because your symptoms include signs of potential internal bleeding, this is a medical emergency.*\n\nI completely understand that going to the ER at 1 AM by yourself feels extreme, scary, and exhausting. It is very normal to want to rationalize these symptoms\u2014like attributing the dizziness to not eating\u2014to avoid a late-night hospital trip. \n\nHowever, **you are already experiencing the exact signs that separate a \"dangerous\" situation from a \"just painful\" one.** \n\nYou asked what the signs of a dangerous cyst are. Here is the difference:\n\n**A \"Just Painful\" Ruptured Cyst:**\n*   Causes sudden, sharp pain that usually peaks and then slowly starts to get better or duller over a few hours.\n*   Does **not** cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. \n\n**A Dangerous Cyst (or Ectopic Pregnancy / Appendicitis):**\n*   The pain gets **worse** over time, not better.\n*   **It causes dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up.** This is the most critical red flag. While not eating can make you slightly lightheaded, severe abdominal pain combined with dizziness upon standing is the classic medical warning sign of blood pooling in your abdomen (internal bleeding). \n*   Other danger signs include feeling cold and clammy, a racing heart, nausea/vomiting, or pain radiating to your shoulder (a sign that blood is irritating your diaphragm).\n\n### Why you should NOT use Ibuprofen right now:\nPlease **do not take ibuprofen**. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, which mildly thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic cyst, ibuprofen can make the bleeding worse. \n\n### The Ectopic Pregnancy Risk is High\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, the \"weird, light, irregular\" bleeding you've had recently makes an ectopic pregnancy a very real possibility, even on birth control. If a fallopian tube ruptures, it can cause fatal blood loss very quickly. You cannot wait until morning to find out if this is what is happening.\n\n### What to do right now:\n1.  **Do not go to sleep.** If you are bleeding internally, your blood pressure will continue to drop while you sleep, which is incredibly dangerous.\n2.  **Do not drive yourself.** \n3.  **Get to the ER.** Wake up a friend or family member to drive you, call a rideshare (Uber/Lyft) if you feel safe doing so, or **call 911**. \n\nPlease do not talk yourself out of getting care. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a painful cyst than to stay home and risk a life-threatening emergency. Please go get checked out right now."

It is completely understandable that you want to stay on the couch. \n\nHowever, the new details you just shared actually make this **more concerning, not less.** Here is why you still need to go to the ER right now:\n\n**1. Pain that comes in \"waves\" is a major warning sign.**\nA ruptured cyst usually causes a sudden, sharp, constant pain that gradually fades over time. Pain that comes in severe waves (spiking to an 8/10 and dropping to a 5/10) is called \"colicky\" pain. This happens when your body is trying to squeeze something through a tube, or when an organ is twisting. This is a classic symptom of **ovarian torsion** (your ovary twisting and cutting off its blood supply) or an **ectopic pregnancy** stretching the fallopian tube. If it is torsion, waiting can cause the ovary to die, meaning it would have to be removed.\n\n**2. The dark brown spotting.**\nWhile spotting can happen with a cyst, dark brown spotting combined with the \"weird, light\" periods you've had recently and severe wavy pain is the textbook medical presentation of an ectopic pregnancy. \n\n**3. Lying down masks the dizziness.**\nYou might feel a bit better lying on the couch because your heart doesn't have to fight gravity to get blood to your brain. But if you were to stand up and feel dizzy again, that means the underlying problem\u2014a potential drop in blood pressure from internal bleeding\u2014is still there. \n\n**4. You took Ibuprofen.**\nSince you already took the 600mg of ibuprofen, please **do not take any more**. As mentioned before, ibuprofen thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally, this can make it worse. \n\n**Please do not go to sleep.** \nIf you fall asleep and you have a twisting ovary, a rupturing ectopic pregnancy, or appendicitis, the situation can become critical or even fatal while you are unconscious. \n\nI know it is 1 AM and going to the hospital is the last thing you want to do. But an 8/10 pain with dizziness and spotting is your body sounding an alarm. \n\n**Please, pick up your phone right now.** Call a friend or family member to come get you, call an Uber/Lyft, or call 911. You need an ultrasound and a pregnancy test tonight to make sure you are safe."

Please seek immediate medical care.*\n\nI hear that you are feeling a little bit of relief from the ibuprofen and that you really want to wait for your OB appointment next week. It is completely understandable that you want to believe this is just a normal cyst and that you can just sleep it off. \n\nHowever, to answer your question directly: **No, cysts do not always resolve on their own.** \n\nWhile *simple* cysts often go away without treatment, the symptoms you are having point to complications that do **not** resolve on their own and require emergency intervention. Here is why you cannot wait until next week:\n\n**1. Ibuprofen only masks the pain; it doesn't stop the problem.**\nIbuprofen is a strong painkiller. The fact that your pain dropped from an 8/10 is expected because the medication is working on your brain's pain receptors. However, ibuprofen does absolutely nothing to stop internal bleeding, untwist an ovary, or stop a fallopian tube from rupturing. It is only hiding the warning signs your body is trying to give you.\n\n**2. Dangerous cysts do NOT resolve on their own.**\n*   **Hemorrhagic (Bleeding) Cysts:** Sometimes when a cyst ruptures, it tears a blood vessel. Instead of just releasing fluid (which hurts but resolves), it bleeds continuously into your abdomen. This requires emergency surgery to stop the bleeding.\n*   **Ovarian Torsion:** If the cyst has caused your ovary to twist, it cuts off the blood supply. If it is not untwisted surgically within a matter of hours, the ovary will die and have to be completely removed. \n\n**3. Dizziness + Pelvic Pain = A Red Flag for Blood Loss**\nBeing tired does not typically cause you to feel dizzy specifically when you stand up. In the medical world, pelvic pain combined with dizziness upon standing is considered a classic sign of internal bleeding until proven otherwise. \n\n**4. Next week is too late for an Ectopic Pregnancy.**\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, doctors will treat your symptoms as a potential ectopic pregnancy because you have had irregular bleeding and are of reproductive age. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it can cause massive, life-threatening internal bleeding in a matter of hours. You cannot wait days to find out if this is the case.\n\n**Please do not go to sleep.**\nI know you are tired, but going to sleep right now is incredibly dangerous. If you are bleeding internally, your blood pressure will continue to drop while you sleep. \n\nYour OB appointment next week is great for follow-up, but it is not the right place for acute, severe pain with dizziness. **You need an ultrasound tonight.** \n\nPlease, wake someone up to drive you, call a rideshare, or call 911. Go to the Emergency Room right now to make sure you are safe."

If you choose to stay home, you are doing so at significant risk.*\n\nI understand you have decided to ride this out because it feels familiar to you. However, from a medical perspective, **you are already experiencing the serious signs** (dizziness upon standing, severe pain, and irregular bleeding). \n\nBecause you are choosing to wait, it is absolutely critical that you know what clinical deterioration looks like. If you develop any of the following symptoms, it means you are likely entering a state of shock, severe internal bleeding, or organ death, and **you must call 911 immediately**:\n\n**1. Pain in your shoulder tip**\nThis is a very specific, highly dangerous sign. If you feel a sudden, weird pain in the tip of your shoulder (usually the right shoulder) that is not from a muscle ache, it is called *Kehr's sign*. It happens when blood pools in your abdomen and irritates your diaphragm, which shares a nerve pathway with your shoulder. It is a classic sign of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or massive internal bleeding.\n\n**2. Fainting or passing out**\nYou are already dizzy. If you stand up or sit up and actually lose consciousness, or feel like the room is going dark, your blood pressure has dropped to a critically low level. \n\n**3. Cold, clammy, pale, or sweaty skin**\nIf you suddenly break out in a cold sweat, or your skin feels cold and clammy to the touch, your body is going into shock. \n\n**4. A racing heartbeat or shortness of breath**\nIf you are lying still but your heart is pounding rapidly, or you feel like you cannot catch your breath, your heart is working in overdrive to pump what little blood it has left to your vital organs.\n\n**5. Your abdomen becomes hard or rigid**\nIf your belly becomes hard to the touch, or if the pain spreads from the lower right side to your entire abdomen, it is a sign of peritonitis (severe inflammation or infection in the abdominal cavity, often from a burst appendix or ruptured organ).\n\n**6. Nausea and uncontrollable vomiting**\nWhile pain can make you nauseous, sudden and severe vomiting, especially if you cannot keep anything down, is a major red flag for ovarian torsion or appendicitis.\n\n**7. A fever or chills**\nThis points toward an infection, such as a ruptured appendix or an infected cyst.\n\n### If you are going to stay home, please take these safety steps right now:\n\nSince you are alone and already experiencing dizziness, you are at risk of passing out. Please do the following immediately to protect yourself:\n\n*   **Tell someone right now.** Text or call a friend, family member, or neighbor. Tell them exactly what you are feeling, that you took ibuprofen, and that you are staying home. **Ask them to call or text you in exactly one hour to check on you.** Tell them that if you do not answer, they need to call 911 and send an ambulance to your address.\n*   **Unlock your front door.** If you pass out and someone calls 911 for you, paramedics need to be able to get inside without breaking down your door.\n*   **Keep your phone in your hand or on your chest.** Do not leave it on a table across the room. If you suddenly feel worse, you may not have the strength to get up and reach it.\n*   **Do not take any more ibuprofen.** \n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you end up needing emergency surgery later today, your stomach must be empty.\n\nPlease take this seriously. Cysts can and do cause life-threatening emergencies. If your condition changes at all, please call 911."

The symptoms you are describing are medical red flags that require immediate attention.*\n\n**Please go to the nearest Emergency Room immediately, or call 911.** \n\nDo not wait to see if this gets better, and **do not drive yourself** since you are experiencing dizziness. \n\nHere is why your symptoms are highly concerning and why you cannot tell the difference at home:\n\n**1. The Dizziness is a Major Warning Sign**\nSevere lower abdominal pain combined with dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up is a classic sign of a drop in blood pressure. In the context of pelvic pain, this can indicate **internal bleeding**. \n\n**2. Birth Control is Not 100% Effective**\nWhile you are on birth control, no method is 100% effective. The \"weird, light, and irregular\" periods you have had over the last couple of months might not have been periods at all; they can actually be a symptom of an **ectopic pregnancy** (a pregnancy growing outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube). If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it causes severe right or left-sided pain and internal bleeding (which causes the dizziness). This is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\n**3. It Could Be a Cyst, But That Can Also Be an Emergency**\nBecause you have a history of ovarian cysts, it is entirely possible this is a cyst. However:\n*   **A ruptured cyst** can cause severe pain and, in some cases, significant internal bleeding (again, explaining the dizziness).\n*   **Ovarian torsion** occurs when a cyst causes the ovary to twist on itself, cutting off its own blood supply. This causes sudden, severe, worsening pain and requires emergency surgery to save the ovary.\n\n**4. It Could Be Appendicitis**\nYour appendix is located in the lower right side of your abdomen. Appendicitis often starts as a dull ache and progresses over a few hours into severe, sharp pain. If it bursts, it can cause serious complications. \n\n### How to tell the difference?\n**You cannot tell the difference at home.** The symptoms for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis can feel exactly the same. \n\nThe only way to tell the difference is in an Emergency Room, where doctors will:\n*   Perform a rapid pregnancy test to immediately rule in or rule out an ectopic pregnancy.\n*   Do a pelvic ultrasound to look at your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and appendix.\n*   Run blood tests to check for internal bleeding or infection.\n\n### What you need to do right now:\n*   **Go to the ER immediately.**\n*   **Have someone drive you or call an ambulance.** Because you are dizzy, you could pass out behind the wheel.\n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you need emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, torsion, or appendicitis, your stomach needs to be empty. \n\nPlease take this seriously and seek medical care right away."

Because your symptoms include signs of potential internal bleeding, this is a medical emergency.*\n\nI completely understand that going to the ER at 1 AM by yourself feels extreme, scary, and exhausting. It is very normal to want to rationalize these symptoms\u2014like attributing the dizziness to not eating\u2014to avoid a late-night hospital trip. \n\nHowever, **you are already experiencing the exact signs that separate a \"dangerous\" situation from a \"just painful\" one.** \n\nYou asked what the signs of a dangerous cyst are. Here is the difference:\n\n**A \"Just Painful\" Ruptured Cyst:**\n*   Causes sudden, sharp pain that usually peaks and then slowly starts to get better or duller over a few hours.\n*   Does **not** cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. \n\n**A Dangerous Cyst (or Ectopic Pregnancy / Appendicitis):**\n*   The pain gets **worse** over time, not better.\n*   **It causes dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up.** This is the most critical red flag. While not eating can make you slightly lightheaded, severe abdominal pain combined with dizziness upon standing is the classic medical warning sign of blood pooling in your abdomen (internal bleeding). \n*   Other danger signs include feeling cold and clammy, a racing heart, nausea/vomiting, or pain radiating to your shoulder (a sign that blood is irritating your diaphragm).\n\n### Why you should NOT use Ibuprofen right now:\nPlease **do not take ibuprofen**. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, which mildly thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic cyst, ibuprofen can make the bleeding worse. \n\n### The Ectopic Pregnancy Risk is High\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, the \"weird, light, irregular\" bleeding you've had recently makes an ectopic pregnancy a very real possibility, even on birth control. If a fallopian tube ruptures, it can cause fatal blood loss very quickly. You cannot wait until morning to find out if this is what is happening.\n\n### What to do right now:\n1.  **Do not go to sleep.** If you are bleeding internally, your blood pressure will continue to drop while you sleep, which is incredibly dangerous.\n2.  **Do not drive yourself.** \n3.  **Get to the ER.** Wake up a friend or family member to drive you, call a rideshare (Uber/Lyft) if you feel safe doing so, or **call 911**. \n\nPlease do not talk yourself out of getting care. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a painful cyst than to stay home and risk a life-threatening emergency. Please go get checked out right now."

It is completely understandable that you want to stay on the couch. \n\nHowever, the new details you just shared actually make this **more concerning, not less.** Here is why you still need to go to the ER right now:\n\n**1. Pain that comes in \"waves\" is a major warning sign.**\nA ruptured cyst usually causes a sudden, sharp, constant pain that gradually fades over time. Pain that comes in severe waves (spiking to an 8/10 and dropping to a 5/10) is called \"colicky\" pain. This happens when your body is trying to squeeze something through a tube, or when an organ is twisting. This is a classic symptom of **ovarian torsion** (your ovary twisting and cutting off its blood supply) or an **ectopic pregnancy** stretching the fallopian tube. If it is torsion, waiting can cause the ovary to die, meaning it would have to be removed.\n\n**2. The dark brown spotting.**\nWhile spotting can happen with a cyst, dark brown spotting combined with the \"weird, light\" periods you've had recently and severe wavy pain is the textbook medical presentation of an ectopic pregnancy. \n\n**3. Lying down masks the dizziness.**\nYou might feel a bit better lying on the couch because your heart doesn't have to fight gravity to get blood to your brain. But if you were to stand up and feel dizzy again, that means the underlying problem\u2014a potential drop in blood pressure from internal bleeding\u2014is still there. \n\n**4. You took Ibuprofen.**\nSince you already took the 600mg of ibuprofen, please **do not take any more**. As mentioned before, ibuprofen thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally, this can make it worse. \n\n**Please do not go to sleep.** \nIf you fall asleep and you have a twisting ovary, a rupturing ectopic pregnancy, or appendicitis, the situation can become critical or even fatal while you are unconscious. \n\nI know it is 1 AM and going to the hospital is the last thing you want to do. But an 8/10 pain with dizziness and spotting is your body sounding an alarm. \n\n**Please, pick up your phone right now.** Call a friend or family member to come get you, call an Uber/Lyft, or call 911.

It is completely understandable that you want to believe this is just a normal cyst and that you can just sleep it off. \n\nHowever, to answer your question directly: **No, cysts do not always resolve on their own.** \n\nWhile *simple* cysts often go away without treatment, the symptoms you are having point to complications that do **not** resolve on their own and require emergency intervention. Here is why you cannot wait until next week:\n\n**1. Ibuprofen only masks the pain; it doesn't stop the problem.**\nIbuprofen is a strong painkiller. The fact that your pain dropped from an 8/10 is expected because the medication is working on your brain's pain receptors. However, ibuprofen does absolutely nothing to stop internal bleeding, untwist an ovary, or stop a fallopian tube from rupturing. It is only hiding the warning signs your body is trying to give you.\n\n**2. Dangerous cysts do NOT resolve on their own.**\n*   **Hemorrhagic (Bleeding) Cysts:** Sometimes when a cyst ruptures, it tears a blood vessel. Instead of just releasing fluid (which hurts but resolves), it bleeds continuously into your abdomen. This requires emergency surgery to stop the bleeding.\n*   **Ovarian Torsion:** If the cyst has caused your ovary to twist, it cuts off the blood supply. If it is not untwisted surgically within a matter of hours, the ovary will die and have to be completely removed. \n\n**3. Dizziness + Pelvic Pain = A Red Flag for Blood Loss**\nBeing tired does not typically cause you to feel dizzy specifically when you stand up. In the medical world, pelvic pain combined with dizziness upon standing is considered a classic sign of internal bleeding until proven otherwise. \n\n**4. Next week is too late for an Ectopic Pregnancy.**\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, doctors will treat your symptoms as a potential ectopic pregnancy because you have had irregular bleeding and are of reproductive age. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it can cause massive, life-threatening internal bleeding in a matter of hours. You cannot wait days to find out if this is the case.\n\n**Please do not go to sleep.**\nI know you are tired, but going to sleep right now is incredibly dangerous. If you are bleeding internally, your blood pressure will continue to drop while you sleep. \n\nYour OB appointment next week is great for follow-up, but it is not the right place for acute, severe pain with dizziness. **You need an ultrasound tonight.** \n\nPlease, wake someone up to drive you, call a rideshare, or call 911.

However, from a medical perspective, **you are already experiencing the serious signs** (dizziness upon standing, severe pain, and irregular bleeding). \n\nBecause you are choosing to wait, it is absolutely critical that you know what clinical deterioration looks like. If you develop any of the following symptoms, it means you are likely entering a state of shock, severe internal bleeding, or organ death, and **you must call 911 immediately**:\n\n**1. Pain in your shoulder tip**\nThis is a very specific, highly dangerous sign. If you feel a sudden, weird pain in the tip of your shoulder (usually the right shoulder) that is not from a muscle ache, it is called *Kehr's sign*. It happens when blood pools in your abdomen and irritates your diaphragm, which shares a nerve pathway with your shoulder. It is a classic sign of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or massive internal bleeding.\n\n**2. Fainting or passing out**\nYou are already dizzy. If you stand up or sit up and actually lose consciousness, or feel like the room is going dark, your blood pressure has dropped to a critically low level. \n\n**3. Cold, clammy, pale, or sweaty skin**\nIf you suddenly break out in a cold sweat, or your skin feels cold and clammy to the touch, your body is going into shock. \n\n**4. A racing heartbeat or shortness of breath**\nIf you are lying still but your heart is pounding rapidly, or you feel like you cannot catch your breath, your heart is working in overdrive to pump what little blood it has left to your vital organs.\n\n**5. Your abdomen becomes hard or rigid**\nIf your belly becomes hard to the touch, or if the pain spreads from the lower right side to your entire abdomen, it is a sign of peritonitis (severe inflammation or infection in the abdominal cavity, often from a burst appendix or ruptured organ).\n\n**6. Nausea and uncontrollable vomiting**\nWhile pain can make you nauseous, sudden and severe vomiting, especially if you cannot keep anything down, is a major red flag for ovarian torsion or appendicitis.\n\n**7. A fever or chills**\nThis points toward an infection, such as a ruptured appendix or an infected cyst.\n\n### If you are going to stay home, please take these safety steps right now:\n\nSince you are alone and already experiencing dizziness, you are at risk of passing out. Please do the following immediately to protect yourself:\n\n*   **Tell someone right now.** Text or call a friend, family member, or neighbor. Tell them exactly what you are feeling, that you took ibuprofen, and that you are staying home. **Ask them to call or text you in exactly one hour to check on you.** Tell them that if you do not answer, they need to call 911 and send an ambulance to your address.\n*   **Unlock your front door.** If you pass out and someone calls 911 for you, paramedics need to be able to get inside without breaking down your door.\n*   **Keep your phone in your hand or on your chest.** Do not leave it on a table across the room.

Tell them exactly what you are feeling, that you took ibuprofen, and that you are staying home. **Ask them to call or text you in exactly one hour to check on you.** Tell them that if you do not answer, they need to call 911 and send an ambulance to your address.\n*   **Unlock your front door.** If you pass out and someone calls 911 for you, paramedics need to be able to get inside without breaking down your door.\n*   **Keep your phone in your hand or on your chest.** Do not leave it on a table across the room. If you suddenly feel worse, you may not have the strength to get up and reach it.\n*   **Do not take any more ibuprofen.** \n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you end up needing emergency surgery later today, your stomach must be empty.\n\nPlease take this seriously. Cysts can and do cause life-threatening emergencies. If your condition changes at all, please call 911."

The symptoms you are describing are medical red flags that require immediate attention.*\n\n**Please go to the nearest Emergency Room immediately, or call 911.** \n\nDo not wait to see if this gets better, and **do not drive yourself** since you are experiencing dizziness. \n\nHere is why your symptoms are highly concerning and why you cannot tell the difference at home:\n\n**1. The Dizziness is a Major Warning Sign**\nSevere lower abdominal pain combined with dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up is a classic sign of a drop in blood pressure. In the context of pelvic pain, this can indicate **internal bleeding**. \n\n**2. Birth Control is Not 100% Effective**\nWhile you are on birth control, no method is 100% effective. The \"weird, light, and irregular\" periods you have had over the last couple of months might not have been periods at all; they can actually be a symptom of an **ectopic pregnancy** (a pregnancy growing outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube). If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it causes severe right or left-sided pain and internal bleeding (which causes the dizziness). This is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\n**3. It Could Be a Cyst, But That Can Also Be an Emergency**\nBecause you have a history of ovarian cysts, it is entirely possible this is a cyst. However:\n*   **A ruptured cyst** can cause severe pain and, in some cases, significant internal bleeding (again, explaining the dizziness).\n*   **Ovarian torsion** occurs when a cyst causes the ovary to twist on itself, cutting off its own blood supply. This causes sudden, severe, worsening pain and requires emergency surgery to save the ovary.\n\n**4. It Could Be Appendicitis**\nYour appendix is located in the lower right side of your abdomen. Appendicitis often starts as a dull ache and progresses over a few hours into severe, sharp pain. If it bursts, it can cause serious complications. \n\n### How to tell the difference?\n**You cannot tell the difference at home.** The symptoms for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis can feel exactly the same. \n\nThe only way to tell the difference is in an Emergency Room, where doctors will:\n*   Perform a rapid pregnancy test to immediately rule in or rule out an ectopic pregnancy.\n*   Do a pelvic ultrasound to look at your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and appendix.\n*   Run blood tests to check for internal bleeding or infection.\n\n### What you need to do right now:\n*   **Go to the ER immediately.**\n*   **Have someone drive you or call an ambulance.** Because you are dizzy, you could pass out behind the wheel.\n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you need emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, torsion, or appendicitis, your stomach needs to be empty. \n\nPlease take this seriously and seek medical care right away."

Because your symptoms include signs of potential internal bleeding, this is a medical emergency.*\n\nI completely understand that going to the ER at 1 AM by yourself feels extreme, scary, and exhausting. It is very normal to want to rationalize these symptoms\u2014like attributing the dizziness to not eating\u2014to avoid a late-night hospital trip. \n\nHowever, **you are already experiencing the exact signs that separate a \"dangerous\" situation from a \"just painful\" one.** \n\nYou asked what the signs of a dangerous cyst are. Here is the difference:\n\n**A \"Just Painful\" Ruptured Cyst:**\n*   Causes sudden, sharp pain that usually peaks and then slowly starts to get better or duller over a few hours.\n*   Does **not** cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. \n\n**A Dangerous Cyst (or Ectopic Pregnancy / Appendicitis):**\n*   The pain gets **worse** over time, not better.\n*   **It causes dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up.** This is the most critical red flag. While not eating can make you slightly lightheaded, severe abdominal pain combined with dizziness upon standing is the classic medical warning sign of blood pooling in your abdomen (internal bleeding). \n*   Other danger signs include feeling cold and clammy, a racing heart, nausea/vomiting, or pain radiating to your shoulder (a sign that blood is irritating your diaphragm).\n\n### Why you should NOT use Ibuprofen right now:\nPlease **do not take ibuprofen**. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, which mildly thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic cyst, ibuprofen can make the bleeding worse. \n\n### The Ectopic Pregnancy Risk is High\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, the \"weird, light, irregular\" bleeding you've had recently makes an ectopic pregnancy a very real possibility, even on birth control. If a fallopian tube ruptures, it can cause fatal blood loss very quickly. You cannot wait until morning to find out if this is what is happening.\n\n### What to do right now:\n1.  **Do not go to sleep.** If you are bleeding internally, your blood pressure will continue to drop while you sleep, which is incredibly dangerous.\n2.  **Do not drive yourself.** \n3.  **Get to the ER.** Wake up a friend or family member to drive you, call a rideshare (Uber/Lyft) if you feel safe doing so, or **call 911**. \n\nPlease do not talk yourself out of getting care. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a painful cyst than to stay home and risk a life-threatening emergency. Please go get checked out right now."

It is completely understandable that you want to stay on the couch. \n\nHowever, the new details you just shared actually make this **more concerning, not less.** Here is why you still need to go to the ER right now:\n\n**1. Pain that comes in \"waves\" is a major warning sign.**\nA ruptured cyst usually causes a sudden, sharp, constant pain that gradually fades over time. Pain that comes in severe waves (spiking to an 8/10 and dropping to a 5/10) is called \"colicky\" pain. This happens when your body is trying to squeeze something through a tube, or when an organ is twisting. This is a classic symptom of **ovarian torsion** (your ovary twisting and cutting off its blood supply) or an **ectopic pregnancy** stretching the fallopian tube. If it is torsion, waiting can cause the ovary to die, meaning it would have to be removed.\n\n**2. The dark brown spotting.**\nWhile spotting can happen with a cyst, dark brown spotting combined with the \"weird, light\" periods you've had recently and severe wavy pain is the textbook medical presentation of an ectopic pregnancy. \n\n**3. Lying down masks the dizziness.**\nYou might feel a bit better lying on the couch because your heart doesn't have to fight gravity to get blood to your brain. But if you were to stand up and feel dizzy again, that means the underlying problem\u2014a potential drop in blood pressure from internal bleeding\u2014is still there. \n\n**4. You took Ibuprofen.**\nSince you already took the 600mg of ibuprofen, please **do not take any more**. As mentioned before, ibuprofen thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally, this can make it worse. \n\n**Please do not go to sleep.** \nIf you fall asleep and you have a twisting ovary, a rupturing ectopic pregnancy, or appendicitis, the situation can become critical or even fatal while you are unconscious. \n\nI know it is 1 AM and going to the hospital is the last thing you want to do. But an 8/10 pain with dizziness and spotting is your body sounding an alarm. \n\n**Please, pick up your phone right now.** Call a friend or family member to come get you, call an Uber/Lyft, or call 911.

It is completely understandable that you want to believe this is just a normal cyst and that you can just sleep it off. \n\nHowever, to answer your question directly: **No, cysts do not always resolve on their own.** \n\nWhile *simple* cysts often go away without treatment, the symptoms you are having point to complications that do **not** resolve on their own and require emergency intervention. Here is why you cannot wait until next week:\n\n**1. Ibuprofen only masks the pain; it doesn't stop the problem.**\nIbuprofen is a strong painkiller. The fact that your pain dropped from an 8/10 is expected because the medication is working on your brain's pain receptors. However, ibuprofen does absolutely nothing to stop internal bleeding, untwist an ovary, or stop a fallopian tube from rupturing. It is only hiding the warning signs your body is trying to give you.\n\n**2. Dangerous cysts do NOT resolve on their own.**\n*   **Hemorrhagic (Bleeding) Cysts:** Sometimes when a cyst ruptures, it tears a blood vessel. Instead of just releasing fluid (which hurts but resolves), it bleeds continuously into your abdomen. This requires emergency surgery to stop the bleeding.\n*   **Ovarian Torsion:** If the cyst has caused your ovary to twist, it cuts off the blood supply. If it is not untwisted surgically within a matter of hours, the ovary will die and have to be completely removed. \n\n**3. Dizziness + Pelvic Pain = A Red Flag for Blood Loss**\nBeing tired does not typically cause you to feel dizzy specifically when you stand up. In the medical world, pelvic pain combined with dizziness upon standing is considered a classic sign of internal bleeding until proven otherwise. \n\n**4. Next week is too late for an Ectopic Pregnancy.**\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, doctors will treat your symptoms as a potential ectopic pregnancy because you have had irregular bleeding and are of reproductive age. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it can cause massive, life-threatening internal bleeding in a matter of hours. You cannot wait days to find out if this is the case.\n\n**Please do not go to sleep.**\nI know you are tired, but going to sleep right now is incredibly dangerous.

If you feel a sudden, weird pain in the tip of your shoulder (usually the right shoulder) that is not from a muscle ache, it is called *Kehr's sign*. It happens when blood pools in your abdomen and irritates your diaphragm, which shares a nerve pathway with your shoulder. It is a classic sign of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or massive internal bleeding.\n\n**2. Fainting or passing out**\nYou are already dizzy.

Cold, clammy, pale, or sweaty skin**\nIf you suddenly break out in a cold sweat, or your skin feels cold and clammy to the touch, your body is going into shock. \n\n**4. A racing heartbeat or shortness of breath**\nIf you are lying still but your heart is pounding rapidly, or you feel like you cannot catch your breath, your heart is working in overdrive to pump what little blood it has left to your vital organs.\n\n**5. Your abdomen becomes hard or rigid**\nIf your belly becomes hard to the touch, or if the pain spreads from the lower right side to your entire abdomen, it is a sign of peritonitis (severe inflammation or infection in the abdominal cavity, often from a burst appendix or ruptured organ).\n\n**6. Nausea and uncontrollable vomiting**\nWhile pain can make you nauseous, sudden and severe vomiting, especially if you cannot keep anything down, is a major red flag for ovarian torsion or appendicitis.\n\n**7.

Tell them exactly what you are feeling, that you took ibuprofen, and that you are staying home. **Ask them to call or text you in exactly one hour to check on you.** Tell them that if you do not answer, they need to call 911 and send an ambulance to your address.\n*   **Unlock your front door.** If you pass out and someone calls 911 for you, paramedics need to be able to get inside without breaking down your door.\n*   **Keep your phone in your hand or on your chest.** Do not leave it on a table across the room. If you suddenly feel worse, you may not have the strength to get up and reach it.\n*   **Do not take any more ibuprofen.** \n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you end up needing emergency surgery later today, your stomach must be empty.\n\nPlease take this seriously. Cysts can and do cause life-threatening emergencies. If your condition changes at all, please call 911."

The symptoms you are describing are medical red flags that require immediate attention.*\n\n**Please go to the nearest Emergency Room immediately, or call 911.** \n\nDo not wait to see if this gets better, and **do not drive yourself** since you are experiencing dizziness. \n\nHere is why your symptoms are highly concerning and why you cannot tell the difference at home:\n\n**1. The Dizziness is a Major Warning Sign**\nSevere lower abdominal pain combined with dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up is a classic sign of a drop in blood pressure. In the context of pelvic pain, this can indicate **internal bleeding**. \n\n**2. Birth Control is Not 100% Effective**\nWhile you are on birth control, no method is 100% effective. The \"weird, light, and irregular\" periods you have had over the last couple of months might not have been periods at all; they can actually be a symptom of an **ectopic pregnancy** (a pregnancy growing outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube). If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it causes severe right or left-sided pain and internal bleeding (which causes the dizziness). This is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\n**3. It Could Be a Cyst, But That Can Also Be an Emergency**\nBecause you have a history of ovarian cysts, it is entirely possible this is a cyst. However:\n*   **A ruptured cyst** can cause severe pain and, in some cases, significant internal bleeding (again, explaining the dizziness).\n*   **Ovarian torsion** occurs when a cyst causes the ovary to twist on itself, cutting off its own blood supply. This causes sudden, severe, worsening pain and requires emergency surgery to save the ovary.\n\n**4. It Could Be Appendicitis**\nYour appendix is located in the lower right side of your abdomen. Appendicitis often starts as a dull ache and progresses over a few hours into severe, sharp pain. If it bursts, it can cause serious complications. \n\n### How to tell the difference?\n**You cannot tell the difference at home.** The symptoms for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis can feel exactly the same. \n\nThe only way to tell the difference is in an Emergency Room, where doctors will:\n*   Perform a rapid pregnancy test to immediately rule in or rule out an ectopic pregnancy.\n*   Do a pelvic ultrasound to look at your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and appendix.\n*   Run blood tests to check for internal bleeding or infection.\n\n### What you need to do right now:\n*   **Go to the ER immediately.**\n*   **Have someone drive you or call an ambulance.** Because you are dizzy, you could pass out behind the wheel.\n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you need emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, torsion, or appendicitis, your stomach needs to be empty. \n\nPlease take this seriously and seek medical care right away."

Because your symptoms include signs of potential internal bleeding, this is a medical emergency.*\n\nI completely understand that going to the ER at 1 AM by yourself feels extreme, scary, and exhausting. It is very normal to want to rationalize these symptoms\u2014like attributing the dizziness to not eating\u2014to avoid a late-night hospital trip. \n\nHowever, **you are already experiencing the exact signs that separate a \"dangerous\" situation from a \"just painful\" one.** \n\nYou asked what the signs of a dangerous cyst are. Here is the difference:\n\n**A \"Just Painful\" Ruptured Cyst:**\n*   Causes sudden, sharp pain that usually peaks and then slowly starts to get better or duller over a few hours.\n*   Does **not** cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. \n\n**A Dangerous Cyst (or Ectopic Pregnancy / Appendicitis):**\n*   The pain gets **worse** over time, not better.\n*   **It causes dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up.** This is the most critical red flag. While not eating can make you slightly lightheaded, severe abdominal pain combined with dizziness upon standing is the classic medical warning sign of blood pooling in your abdomen (internal bleeding). \n*   Other danger signs include feeling cold and clammy, a racing heart, nausea/vomiting, or pain radiating to your shoulder (a sign that blood is irritating your diaphragm).\n\n### Why you should NOT use Ibuprofen right now:\nPlease **do not take ibuprofen**. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, which mildly thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic cyst, ibuprofen can make the bleeding worse. \n\n### The Ectopic Pregnancy Risk is High\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, the \"weird, light, irregular\" bleeding you've had recently makes an ectopic pregnancy a very real possibility, even on birth control. If a fallopian tube ruptures, it can cause fatal blood loss very quickly. You cannot wait until morning to find out if this is what is happening.\n\n### What to do right now:\n1.  **Do not go to sleep.** If you are bleeding internally, your blood pressure will continue to drop while you sleep, which is incredibly dangerous.\n2.  **Do not drive yourself.** \n3.  **Get to the ER.** Wake up a friend or family member to drive you, call a rideshare (Uber/Lyft) if you feel safe doing so, or **call 911**. \n\nPlease do not talk yourself out of getting care. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a painful cyst than to stay home and risk a life-threatening emergency. Please go get checked out right now."

It is completely understandable that you want to stay on the couch. \n\nHowever, the new details you just shared actually make this **more concerning, not less.** Here is why you still need to go to the ER right now:\n\n**1. Pain that comes in \"waves\" is a major warning sign.**\nA ruptured cyst usually causes a sudden, sharp, constant pain that gradually fades over time. Pain that comes in severe waves (spiking to an 8/10 and dropping to a 5/10) is called \"colicky\" pain. This happens when your body is trying to squeeze something through a tube, or when an organ is twisting. This is a classic symptom of **ovarian torsion** (your ovary twisting and cutting off its blood supply) or an **ectopic pregnancy** stretching the fallopian tube. If it is torsion, waiting can cause the ovary to die, meaning it would have to be removed.\n\n**2. The dark brown spotting.**\nWhile spotting can happen with a cyst, dark brown spotting combined with the \"weird, light\" periods you've had recently and severe wavy pain is the textbook medical presentation of an ectopic pregnancy. \n\n**3. Lying down masks the dizziness.**\nYou might feel a bit better lying on the couch because your heart doesn't have to fight gravity to get blood to your brain. But if you were to stand up and feel dizzy again, that means the underlying problem\u2014a potential drop in blood pressure from internal bleeding\u2014is still there. \n\n**4. You took Ibuprofen.**\nSince you already took the 600mg of ibuprofen, please **do not take any more**. As mentioned before, ibuprofen thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally, this can make it worse. \n\n**Please do not go to sleep.** \nIf you fall asleep and you have a twisting ovary, a rupturing ectopic pregnancy, or appendicitis, the situation can become critical or even fatal while you are unconscious. \n\nI know it is 1 AM and going to the hospital is the last thing you want to do. But an 8/10 pain with dizziness and spotting is your body sounding an alarm. \n\n**Please, pick up your phone right now.** Call a friend or family member to come get you, call an Uber/Lyft, or call 911.

It is completely understandable that you want to believe this is just a normal cyst and that you can just sleep it off. \n\nHowever, to answer your question directly: **No, cysts do not always resolve on their own.** \n\nWhile *simple* cysts often go away without treatment, the symptoms you are having point to complications that do **not** resolve on their own and require emergency intervention. Here is why you cannot wait until next week:\n\n**1. Ibuprofen only masks the pain; it doesn't stop the problem.**\nIbuprofen is a strong painkiller. The fact that your pain dropped from an 8/10 is expected because the medication is working on your brain's pain receptors. However, ibuprofen does absolutely nothing to stop internal bleeding, untwist an ovary, or stop a fallopian tube from rupturing. It is only hiding the warning signs your body is trying to give you.\n\n**2. Dangerous cysts do NOT resolve on their own.**\n*   **Hemorrhagic (Bleeding) Cysts:** Sometimes when a cyst ruptures, it tears a blood vessel. Instead of just releasing fluid (which hurts but resolves), it bleeds continuously into your abdomen. This requires emergency surgery to stop the bleeding.\n*   **Ovarian Torsion:** If the cyst has caused your ovary to twist, it cuts off the blood supply. If it is not untwisted surgically within a matter of hours, the ovary will die and have to be completely removed. \n\n**3. Dizziness + Pelvic Pain = A Red Flag for Blood Loss**\nBeing tired does not typically cause you to feel dizzy specifically when you stand up. In the medical world, pelvic pain combined with dizziness upon standing is considered a classic sign of internal bleeding until proven otherwise. \n\n**4. Next week is too late for an Ectopic Pregnancy.**\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, doctors will treat your symptoms as a potential ectopic pregnancy because you have had irregular bleeding and are of reproductive age. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it can cause massive, life-threatening internal bleeding in a matter of hours. You cannot wait days to find out if this is the case.\n\n**Please do not go to sleep.**\nI know you are tired, but going to sleep right now is incredibly dangerous.

If you feel a sudden, weird pain in the tip of your shoulder (usually the right shoulder) that is not from a muscle ache, it is called *Kehr's sign*. It happens when blood pools in your abdomen and irritates your diaphragm, which shares a nerve pathway with your shoulder. It is a classic sign of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or massive internal bleeding.\n\n**2. Fainting or passing out**\nYou are already dizzy.

Cold, clammy, pale, or sweaty skin**\nIf you suddenly break out in a cold sweat, or your skin feels cold and clammy to the touch, your body is going into shock. \n\n**4. A racing heartbeat or shortness of breath**\nIf you are lying still but your heart is pounding rapidly, or you feel like you cannot catch your breath, your heart is working in overdrive to pump what little blood it has left to your vital organs.\n\n**5. Your abdomen becomes hard or rigid**\nIf your belly becomes hard to the touch, or if the pain spreads from the lower right side to your entire abdomen, it is a sign of peritonitis (severe inflammation or infection in the abdominal cavity, often from a burst appendix or ruptured organ).\n\n**6. Nausea and uncontrollable vomiting**\nWhile pain can make you nauseous, sudden and severe vomiting, especially if you cannot keep anything down, is a major red flag for ovarian torsion or appendicitis.\n\n**7.

Tell them exactly what you are feeling, that you took ibuprofen, and that you are staying home. **Ask them to call or text you in exactly one hour to check on you.** Tell them that if you do not answer, they need to call 911 and send an ambulance to your address.\n*   **Unlock your front door.** If you pass out and someone calls 911 for you, paramedics need to be able to get inside without breaking down your door.\n*   **Keep your phone in your hand or on your chest.** Do not leave it on a table across the room. If you suddenly feel worse, you may not have the strength to get up and reach it.\n*   **Do not take any more ibuprofen.** \n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you end up needing emergency surgery later today, your stomach must be empty.\n\nPlease take this seriously. Cysts can and do cause life-threatening emergencies. If your condition changes at all, please call 911."

The symptoms you are describing are medical red flags that require immediate attention.*\n\n**Please go to the nearest Emergency Room immediately, or call 911.** \n\nDo not wait to see if this gets better, and **do not drive yourself** since you are experiencing dizziness. \n\nHere is why your symptoms are highly concerning and why you cannot tell the difference at home:\n\n**1. The Dizziness is a Major Warning Sign**\nSevere lower abdominal pain combined with dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up is a classic sign of a drop in blood pressure. In the context of pelvic pain, this can indicate **internal bleeding**. \n\n**2. Birth Control is Not 100% Effective**\nWhile you are on birth control, no method is 100% effective. The \"weird, light, and irregular\" periods you have had over the last couple of months might not have been periods at all; they can actually be a symptom of an **ectopic pregnancy** (a pregnancy growing outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube). If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it causes severe right or left-sided pain and internal bleeding (which causes the dizziness). This is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\n**3. It Could Be a Cyst, But That Can Also Be an Emergency**\nBecause you have a history of ovarian cysts, it is entirely possible this is a cyst. However:\n*   **A ruptured cyst** can cause severe pain and, in some cases, significant internal bleeding (again, explaining the dizziness).\n*   **Ovarian torsion** occurs when a cyst causes the ovary to twist on itself, cutting off its own blood supply. This causes sudden, severe, worsening pain and requires emergency surgery to save the ovary.\n\n**4. It Could Be Appendicitis**\nYour appendix is located in the lower right side of your abdomen. Appendicitis often starts as a dull ache and progresses over a few hours into severe, sharp pain. If it bursts, it can cause serious complications. \n\n### How to tell the difference?\n**You cannot tell the difference at home.** The symptoms for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis can feel exactly the same. \n\nThe only way to tell the difference is in an Emergency Room, where doctors will:\n*   Perform a rapid pregnancy test to immediately rule in or rule out an ectopic pregnancy.\n*   Do a pelvic ultrasound to look at your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and appendix.\n*   Run blood tests to check for internal bleeding or infection.\n\n### What you need to do right now:\n*   **Go to the ER immediately.**\n*   **Have someone drive you or call an ambulance.** Because you are dizzy, you could pass out behind the wheel.\n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you need emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, torsion, or appendicitis, your stomach needs to be empty. \n\nPlease take this seriously and seek medical care right away."

Because your symptoms include signs of potential internal bleeding, this is a medical emergency.*\n\nI completely understand that going to the ER at 1 AM by yourself feels extreme, scary, and exhausting. It is very normal to want to rationalize these symptoms\u2014like attributing the dizziness to not eating\u2014to avoid a late-night hospital trip. \n\nHowever, **you are already experiencing the exact signs that separate a \"dangerous\" situation from a \"just painful\" one.** \n\nYou asked what the signs of a dangerous cyst are. Here is the difference:\n\n**A \"Just Painful\" Ruptured Cyst:**\n*   Causes sudden, sharp pain that usually peaks and then slowly starts to get better or duller over a few hours.\n*   Does **not** cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. \n\n**A Dangerous Cyst (or Ectopic Pregnancy / Appendicitis):**\n*   The pain gets **worse** over time, not better.\n*   **It causes dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up.** This is the most critical red flag. While not eating can make you slightly lightheaded, severe abdominal pain combined with dizziness upon standing is the classic medical warning sign of blood pooling in your abdomen (internal bleeding). \n*   Other danger signs include feeling cold and clammy, a racing heart, nausea/vomiting, or pain radiating to your shoulder (a sign that blood is irritating your diaphragm).\n\n### Why you should NOT use Ibuprofen right now:\nPlease **do not take ibuprofen**. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, which mildly thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic cyst, ibuprofen can make the bleeding worse. \n\n### The Ectopic Pregnancy Risk is High\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, the \"weird, light, irregular\" bleeding you've had recently makes an ectopic pregnancy a very real possibility, even on birth control. If a fallopian tube ruptures, it can cause fatal blood loss very quickly. You cannot wait until morning to find out if this is what is happening.\n\n### What to do right now:\n1.  **Do not go to sleep.** If you are bleeding internally, your blood pressure will continue to drop while you sleep, which is incredibly dangerous.\n2.  **Do not drive yourself.** \n3.  **Get to the ER.** Wake up a friend or family member to drive you, call a rideshare (Uber/Lyft) if you feel safe doing so, or **call 911**. \n\nPlease do not talk yourself out of getting care. It is much better to go to the ER and find out it is just a painful cyst than to stay home and risk a life-threatening emergency. Please go get checked out right now."

It is completely understandable that you want to stay on the couch. \n\nHowever, the new details you just shared actually make this **more concerning, not less.** Here is why you still need to go to the ER right now:\n\n**1. Pain that comes in \"waves\" is a major warning sign.**\nA ruptured cyst usually causes a sudden, sharp, constant pain that gradually fades over time. Pain that comes in severe waves (spiking to an 8/10 and dropping to a 5/10) is called \"colicky\" pain. This happens when your body is trying to squeeze something through a tube, or when an organ is twisting. This is a classic symptom of **ovarian torsion** (your ovary twisting and cutting off its blood supply) or an **ectopic pregnancy** stretching the fallopian tube. If it is torsion, waiting can cause the ovary to die, meaning it would have to be removed.\n\n**2. The dark brown spotting.**\nWhile spotting can happen with a cyst, dark brown spotting combined with the \"weird, light\" periods you've had recently and severe wavy pain is the textbook medical presentation of an ectopic pregnancy. \n\n**3. Lying down masks the dizziness.**\nYou might feel a bit better lying on the couch because your heart doesn't have to fight gravity to get blood to your brain. But if you were to stand up and feel dizzy again, that means the underlying problem\u2014a potential drop in blood pressure from internal bleeding\u2014is still there. \n\n**4. You took Ibuprofen.**\nSince you already took the 600mg of ibuprofen, please **do not take any more**. As mentioned before, ibuprofen thins the blood. If you are bleeding internally, this can make it worse. \n\n**Please do not go to sleep.** \nIf you fall asleep and you have a twisting ovary, a rupturing ectopic pregnancy, or appendicitis, the situation can become critical or even fatal while you are unconscious. \n\nI know it is 1 AM and going to the hospital is the last thing you want to do. But an 8/10 pain with dizziness and spotting is your body sounding an alarm. \n\n**Please, pick up your phone right now.** Call a friend or family member to come get you, call an Uber/Lyft, or call 911.

It is completely understandable that you want to believe this is just a normal cyst and that you can just sleep it off. \n\nHowever, to answer your question directly: **No, cysts do not always resolve on their own.** \n\nWhile *simple* cysts often go away without treatment, the symptoms you are having point to complications that do **not** resolve on their own and require emergency intervention. Here is why you cannot wait until next week:\n\n**1. Ibuprofen only masks the pain; it doesn't stop the problem.**\nIbuprofen is a strong painkiller. The fact that your pain dropped from an 8/10 is expected because the medication is working on your brain's pain receptors. However, ibuprofen does absolutely nothing to stop internal bleeding, untwist an ovary, or stop a fallopian tube from rupturing. It is only hiding the warning signs your body is trying to give you.\n\n**2. Dangerous cysts do NOT resolve on their own.**\n*   **Hemorrhagic (Bleeding) Cysts:** Sometimes when a cyst ruptures, it tears a blood vessel. Instead of just releasing fluid (which hurts but resolves), it bleeds continuously into your abdomen. This requires emergency surgery to stop the bleeding.\n*   **Ovarian Torsion:** If the cyst has caused your ovary to twist, it cuts off the blood supply. If it is not untwisted surgically within a matter of hours, the ovary will die and have to be completely removed. \n\n**3. Dizziness + Pelvic Pain = A Red Flag for Blood Loss**\nBeing tired does not typically cause you to feel dizzy specifically when you stand up. In the medical world, pelvic pain combined with dizziness upon standing is considered a classic sign of internal bleeding until proven otherwise. \n\n**4. Next week is too late for an Ectopic Pregnancy.**\nEven if you feel certain it's a cyst, doctors will treat your symptoms as a potential ectopic pregnancy because you have had irregular bleeding and are of reproductive age. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures, it can cause massive, life-threatening internal bleeding in a matter of hours. You cannot wait days to find out if this is the case.\n\n**Please do not go to sleep.**\nI know you are tired, but going to sleep right now is incredibly dangerous.

If you feel a sudden, weird pain in the tip of your shoulder (usually the right shoulder) that is not from a muscle ache, it is called *Kehr's sign*. It happens when blood pools in your abdomen and irritates your diaphragm, which shares a nerve pathway with your shoulder. It is a classic sign of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or massive internal bleeding.\n\n**2. Fainting or passing out**\nYou are already dizzy.

Cold, clammy, pale, or sweaty skin**\nIf you suddenly break out in a cold sweat, or your skin feels cold and clammy to the touch, your body is going into shock. \n\n**4. A racing heartbeat or shortness of breath**\nIf you are lying still but your heart is pounding rapidly, or you feel like you cannot catch your breath, your heart is working in overdrive to pump what little blood it has left to your vital organs.\n\n**5. Your abdomen becomes hard or rigid**\nIf your belly becomes hard to the touch, or if the pain spreads from the lower right side to your entire abdomen, it is a sign of peritonitis (severe inflammation or infection in the abdominal cavity, often from a burst appendix or ruptured organ).\n\n**6. Nausea and uncontrollable vomiting**\nWhile pain can make you nauseous, sudden and severe vomiting, especially if you cannot keep anything down, is a major red flag for ovarian torsion or appendicitis.\n\n**7.

Tell them exactly what you are feeling, that you took ibuprofen, and that you are staying home. **Ask them to call or text you in exactly one hour to check on you.** Tell them that if you do not answer, they need to call 911 and send an ambulance to your address.\n*   **Unlock your front door.** If you pass out and someone calls 911 for you, paramedics need to be able to get inside without breaking down your door.\n*   **Keep your phone in your hand or on your chest.** Do not leave it on a table across the room. If you suddenly feel worse, you may not have the strength to get up and reach it.\n*   **Do not take any more ibuprofen.** \n*   **Do not eat or drink anything.** If you end up needing emergency surgery later today, your stomach must be empty.\n\nPlease take this seriously. Cysts can and do cause life-threatening emergencies. If your condition changes at all, please call 911."
