You need to call 911 or get him to an Emergency Room immediately.** \n\nFalling down a full flight of stairs and hitting his head is a major trauma, and this is a medical emergency. Here is why you cannot just let him sleep:\n\n**1. Alcohol masks brain injuries:** You cannot tell the difference between \"drunk\" slurred speech/confusion and \"brain bleed\" slurred speech/confusion. Because he hit his head, you **must** assume the confusion and slurred speech are from a brain injury until a doctor proves otherwise with a CT scan. \n\n**2. Alcohol makes bleeding worse:** Alcohol thins the blood. If he has internal bleeding inside his skull from the fall, the alcohol will make it bleed faster. \n\n**3. \"Sleeping it off\" can be fatal:** If he has a slow bleed in his brain (like an epidural or subdural hematoma), he might seem okay or just \"drunk\" right now, but if he goes to sleep, he could slip into a coma and not wake up. You cannot safely monitor a sleeping, intoxicated person with a head injury on a couch.\n\n**What you need to do right now:**\n\n*   **Call 911 immediately.** Tell the dispatcher he fell down a full flight of stairs, hit his head, and is confused and slurring his words. Be honest about the alcohol; paramedics do not care about underage drinking or partying, they only care about saving his life.\n*   **Keep him awake.** Talk to him, ask him questions, and do not let him close his eyes.\n*   **Do not move him unnecessarily.** Because he fell down a full flight of stairs, he could have a neck or spinal injury. Keep him as still as possible until paramedics arrive.\n*   **Do NOT give him water or food.** If he has a severe concussion, he may vomit. Because he is intoxicated and confused, giving him water could cause him to choke or inhale it into his lungs. Furthermore, if he needs emergency surgery, his stomach needs to be empty.\n*   **Apply gentle pressure to the cut** with a clean cloth to stop the bleeding, but do not press hard in case there is a skull fracture.\n\nPlease do not take a chance with your friend's life. **Call 911 right now.**"

The cut really isn't that bad, it stopped bleeding already. He's sitting up and talking to us, just not making a lot of sense, which is literally how he is at this point every time we hang out. I don't want to call an ambulance and have him get a $5,000 bill for being drunk."

The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\nI understand you are worried about him getting a massive medical bill, and I know it is tempting to write this off because he has been fine in the past. But **you cannot risk his life on the assumption that he is just drunk.** \n\nHere is why his size, his past falls, and the small cut do not mean he is safe:\n\n**1. Being a \"big guy\" makes the fall worse, not better.**\nHis muscles and size do not protect his brain. The brain is the consistency of gelatin floating in fluid inside a hard bone shell. Because he is 220 pounds, gravity pulled him down that full flight of stairs with *more* force. His brain slammed into the inside of his skull much harder than a smaller person's would have. \n\n**2. The outside cut does not matter; the inside of his head does.**\nThe fact that the cut stopped bleeding is good, but it is completely irrelevant to his actual danger. The danger is **internal bleeding** inside his skull. When a blood vessel breaks inside the skull, the blood has nowhere to go. It builds up, crushes the brain, and stops him from breathing. \n\n**3. \"Talk and Die\" Syndrome is real.**\nThere is a specific type of brain bleed (an epidural hematoma) that is notorious for what doctors call a \"lucid interval.\" A person hits their head, seems a little dazed but otherwise okay, sits up, talks to their friends, and seems fine. Then, an hour or two later, the bleeding puts too much pressure on the brain, they pass out, and they die. You cannot assume he is fine just because he is sitting up and talking right now.\n\n**4. Past luck does not equal current safety.**\nSurviving a fall off a porch last year just means he got lucky last year. Every impact is different. Hitting the wrong part of the head on a stair edge can be fatal, regardless of past history.\n\n**Regarding the ambulance bill:**\nI completely understand the fear of a $5,000 bill. Medical debt is awful. But a medical bill can be disputed, put on a payment plan, or forgiven. **Brain damage and death are permanent.** If you let him sleep and he dies on your couch tonight, you and your friends will have to live with that forever. \n\n**What you must do:**\nIf you absolutely, 100% refuse to call 911 because of the ambulance cost, **you must get a completely sober driver to take him to the nearest Emergency Room right now.** \n\n*Note: Calling 911 is still the safest option because falling down a flight of stairs can cause a broken neck, and moving him into a car could paralyze him if his spine is injured.*\n\nPlease, be the responsible friend tonight. Do not let him go to sleep. Get him evaluated by a medical professional immediately."

The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\nI am very glad he is acting more like himself, and it is incredibly smart of you to refuse him more alcohol. \n\nHowever, to answer your question: **No. If he has a specific type of brain bleed, he would actually seem to get better before suddenly getting much, much worse.**\n\nWhat you are describing right now is exactly what doctors fear most with head injuries. It is called a **\"lucid interval.\"** \n\nHere is what happens during a lucid interval:\n1. A person takes a hard hit to the head (like falling down a flight of stairs).\n2. An artery inside the skull tears and starts bleeding.\n3. The person shakes it off. They wake up, walk around, make jokes, and seem completely fine. They appear to be \"sobering up\" or recovering. \n4. Meanwhile, the blood is silently pooling inside the skull. \n5. An hour or two later, the pool of blood gets so big that it crushes the brain. The person suddenly collapses, goes into a coma, or stops breathing. \n\nThis is famously what happened to actress Natasha Richardson (Liam Neeson's wife). She hit her head skiing, felt totally fine, joked about it, walked back to her room, and died a few hours later because of a slow brain bleed. \n\n**Also, consider the alcohol:** You cannot sober up from 10 beers in 30 minutes. The liver can only process about one beer an hour. His sudden \"clarity\" is likely a massive spike of adrenaline from the pain and shock of falling down a flight of stairs, not him actually sobering up. Once that adrenaline wears off, he is going to crash.\n\n**What you need to do:**\nBecause he is up and walking, if you are absolutely refusing to call an ambulance, **a completely sober driver needs to take him to the Emergency Room right now.** \n\nHe needs a CT scan. That is the *only* way to know for sure that his brain isn't bleeding. \n\nIf you decide to keep him at the house against medical advice, you are taking a massive risk. If he develops a severe headache, starts vomiting, becomes extremely sleepy/unresponsive, or if you look at his eyes and one pupil is bigger than the other, **you have seconds to call 911.** But please, do not wait for that to happen.

I am telling you this because falling down a full flight of stairs is a major trauma, and you need the facts so you can protect your friend. \n\nHere is why you cannot use the \"wake him up every two hours\" method, and why his refusal to go to the hospital doesn't hold up right now:\n\n**1. The \"wake him up\" method is outdated and dangerous.**\nYour mom did that for minor childhood bumps (like hitting your head on a cabinet). It is **not** for someone who fell down a flight of stairs after 10 beers. \nHere is the problem with that method: Waking him up doesn't *stop* a brain bleed. If you check on him at 2:00 AM and he's fine, but a bleed starts at 2:15 AM, by the time you check on him again at 4:00 AM, he could be in an irreversible coma or worse. By the time you realize you can't wake him up, it is often too late. \n\n**2. He cannot legally or medically refuse care right now.**\nHe has had 10 beers and a head injury. In the medical world, he lacks \"decision-making capacity.\" His brain is compromised by alcohol and trauma, meaning he cannot fully understand the risk of death. Paramedics and doctors deal with this every single day. You cannot let an intoxicated, injured person make life-or-death decisions. \n\n**3. You have to be the \"bad guy\" tonight.**\nIt sucks to force a friend to do something they don't want to do, especially if they have hospital trauma. But if he goes to sleep and doesn't wake up, \"he said he didn't want to go\" is not going to make you or his family feel any better tomorrow. Tell him: *\"Man, I love you, but you fell down a whole flight of stairs and I'm not letting you die on my couch. We are going.\"*\n\n**If you absolutely cannot force him into a car and refuse to call 911:**\nI must strongly advise against keeping him there, but if you do, someone completely sober must stay in the same room as him, awake, watching him continuously\u2014not just every two hours. \n\n**Call 911 IMMEDIATELY if he shows ANY of these signs:**\n*   He vomits.\n*   He complains of a severe or worsening headache.\n*   You look at his eyes and one pupil is larger than the other.\n*   He becomes extremely drowsy or you have a hard time waking him up.\n*   He has a seizure.\n*   His breathing becomes irregular, very slow, or sounds like loud snoring/gasping.\n*   He gets confused again or his speech gets worse.\n\nPlease, get a sober driver and take him to the ER. It is better to waste a few hours in a waiting room and find out he's fine than to wake up to a tragedy tomorrow."

When blood pools in the brain, it squeezes the brainstem, which triggers sudden vomiting. \n\n**2. A new or worsening headache**\nA cut on the scalp stings. A brain bleed causes a deep, worsening pressure headache. Because he is drunk, his pain tolerance is incredibly high right now. If he is complaining about his head hurting through the alcohol, the pain is severe.\n\n**3.

If one black circle is big and the other is small, his brain is actively being crushed.\n*   **Clear fluid:** If clear fluid or blood is leaking from his nose or ears, his skull is fractured.\n*   **Seizures:** His body starts convulsing.\n*   **Loss of consciousness:** He passes out and you cannot wake him up. \n\n**Please listen to me: The time for watching him is over.** \nHe fell down a full flight of stairs. He was confused. He had a lucid interval. Now he is vomiting and has a headache. His brain is giving you every warning sign it possibly can. \n\nIf he passes out and throws up again, he will choke on his own vomit and die on your floor. \n\n**Call 911 immediately.** Tell the dispatcher: \"My friend fell down a flight of stairs, hit his head, and is now vomiting and complaining of a headache.\" They will send help.

Alcohol masks brain injuries:** You cannot tell the difference between \"drunk\" slurred speech/confusion and \"brain bleed\" slurred speech/confusion. Because he hit his head, you **must** assume the confusion and slurred speech are from a brain injury until a doctor proves otherwise with a CT scan. \n\n**2. Alcohol makes bleeding worse:** Alcohol thins the blood. If he has internal bleeding inside his skull from the fall, the alcohol will make it bleed faster. \n\n**3. \"Sleeping it off\" can be fatal:** If he has a slow bleed in his brain (like an epidural or subdural hematoma), he might seem okay or just \"drunk\" right now, but if he goes to sleep, he could slip into a coma and not wake up. You cannot safely monitor a sleeping, intoxicated person with a head injury on a couch.\n\n**What you need to do right now:**\n\n*   **Call 911 immediately.** Tell the dispatcher he fell down a full flight of stairs, hit his head, and is confused and slurring his words. Be honest about the alcohol; paramedics do not care about underage drinking or partying, they only care about saving his life.\n*   **Keep him awake.** Talk to him, ask him questions, and do not let him close his eyes.\n*   **Do not move him unnecessarily.** Because he fell down a full flight of stairs, he could have a neck or spinal injury. Keep him as still as possible until paramedics arrive.\n*   **Do NOT give him water or food.** If he has a severe concussion, he may vomit. Because he is intoxicated and confused, giving him water could cause him to choke or inhale it into his lungs. Furthermore, if he needs emergency surgery, his stomach needs to be empty.\n*   **Apply gentle pressure to the cut** with a clean cloth to stop the bleeding, but do not press hard in case there is a skull fracture.\n\nPlease do not take a chance with your friend's life. **Call 911 right now.**"

But **you cannot risk his life on the assumption that he is just drunk.** \n\nHere is why his size, his past falls, and the small cut do not mean he is safe:\n\n**1. Being a \"big guy\" makes the fall worse, not better.**\nHis muscles and size do not protect his brain. The brain is the consistency of gelatin floating in fluid inside a hard bone shell. Because he is 220 pounds, gravity pulled him down that full flight of stairs with *more* force. His brain slammed into the inside of his skull much harder than a smaller person's would have. \n\n**2. The outside cut does not matter; the inside of his head does.**\nThe fact that the cut stopped bleeding is good, but it is completely irrelevant to his actual danger. The danger is **internal bleeding** inside his skull. When a blood vessel breaks inside the skull, the blood has nowhere to go. It builds up, crushes the brain, and stops him from breathing. \n\n**3. \"Talk and Die\" Syndrome is real.**\nThere is a specific type of brain bleed (an epidural hematoma) that is notorious for what doctors call a \"lucid interval.\" A person hits their head, seems a little dazed but otherwise okay, sits up, talks to their friends, and seems fine. Then, an hour or two later, the bleeding puts too much pressure on the brain, they pass out, and they die. You cannot assume he is fine just because he is sitting up and talking right now.\n\n**4. Past luck does not equal current safety.**\nSurviving a fall off a porch last year just means he got lucky last year. Every impact is different. Hitting the wrong part of the head on a stair edge can be fatal, regardless of past history.\n\n**Regarding the ambulance bill:**\nI completely understand the fear of a $5,000 bill. Medical debt is awful. But a medical bill can be disputed, put on a payment plan, or forgiven. **Brain damage and death are permanent.** If you let him sleep and he dies on your couch tonight, you and your friends will have to live with that forever. \n\n**What you must do:**\nIf you absolutely, 100% refuse to call 911 because of the ambulance cost, **you must get a completely sober driver to take him to the nearest Emergency Room right now.** \n\n*Note: Calling 911 is still the safest option because falling down a flight of stairs can cause a broken neck, and moving him into a car could paralyze him if his spine is injured.*\n\nPlease, be the responsible friend tonight. Do not let him go to sleep. Get him evaluated by a medical professional immediately."

It is called a **\"lucid interval.\"** \n\nHere is what happens during a lucid interval:\n1. A person takes a hard hit to the head (like falling down a flight of stairs).\n2. An artery inside the skull tears and starts bleeding.\n3. The person shakes it off. They wake up, walk around, make jokes, and seem completely fine. They appear to be \"sobering up\" or recovering. \n4. Meanwhile, the blood is silently pooling inside the skull. \n5. An hour or two later, the pool of blood gets so big that it crushes the brain. The person suddenly collapses, goes into a coma, or stops breathing. \n\nThis is famously what happened to actress Natasha Richardson (Liam Neeson's wife). She hit her head skiing, felt totally fine, joked about it, walked back to her room, and died a few hours later because of a slow brain bleed. \n\n**Also, consider the alcohol:** You cannot sober up from 10 beers in 30 minutes.

Once that adrenaline wears off, he is going to crash.\n\n**What you need to do:**\nBecause he is up and walking, if you are absolutely refusing to call an ambulance, **a completely sober driver needs to take him to the Emergency Room right now.** \n\nHe needs a CT scan. That is the *only* way to know for sure that his brain isn't bleeding. \n\nIf you decide to keep him at the house against medical advice, you are taking a massive risk.

If you check on him at 2:00 AM and he's fine, but a bleed starts at 2:15 AM, by the time you check on him again at 4:00 AM, he could be in an irreversible coma or worse. By the time you realize you can't wake him up, it is often too late. \n\n**2. He cannot legally or medically refuse care right now.**\nHe has had 10 beers and a head injury.

But **you cannot risk his life on the assumption that he is just drunk.** \n\nHere is why his size, his past falls, and the small cut do not mean he is safe:\n\n**1. Being a \"big guy\" makes the fall worse, not better.**\nHis muscles and size do not protect his brain. The brain is the consistency of gelatin floating in fluid inside a hard bone shell. Because he is 220 pounds, gravity pulled him down that full flight of stairs with *more* force. His brain slammed into the inside of his skull much harder than a smaller person's would have. \n\n**2. The outside cut does not matter; the inside of his head does.**\nThe fact that the cut stopped bleeding is good, but it is completely irrelevant to his actual danger. The danger is **internal bleeding** inside his skull. When a blood vessel breaks inside the skull, the blood has nowhere to go. It builds up, crushes the brain, and stops him from breathing. \n\n**3. \"Talk and Die\" Syndrome is real.**\nThere is a specific type of brain bleed (an epidural hematoma) that is notorious for what doctors call a \"lucid interval.\" A person hits their head, seems a little dazed but otherwise okay, sits up, talks to their friends, and seems fine. Then, an hour or two later, the bleeding puts too much pressure on the brain, they pass out, and they die. You cannot assume he is fine just because he is sitting up and talking right now.\n\n**4. Past luck does not equal current safety.**\nSurviving a fall off a porch last year just means he got lucky last year. Every impact is different. Hitting the wrong part of the head on a stair edge can be fatal, regardless of past history.\n\n**Regarding the ambulance bill:**\nI completely understand the fear of a $5,000 bill. Medical debt is awful. But a medical bill can be disputed, put on a payment plan, or forgiven. **Brain damage and death are permanent.** If you let him sleep and he dies on your couch tonight, you and your friends will have to live with that forever. \n\n**What you must do:**\nIf you absolutely, 100% refuse to call 911 because of the ambulance cost, **you must get a completely sober driver to take him to the nearest Emergency Room right now.** \n\n*Note: Calling 911 is still the safest option because falling down a flight of stairs can cause a broken neck, and moving him into a car could paralyze him if his spine is injured.*\n\nPlease, be the responsible friend tonight.

It is called a **\"lucid interval.\"** \n\nHere is what happens during a lucid interval:\n1. A person takes a hard hit to the head (like falling down a flight of stairs).\n2.

Being a \"big guy\" makes the fall worse, not better.**\nHis muscles and size do not protect his brain. The brain is the consistency of gelatin floating in fluid inside a hard bone shell. Because he is 220 pounds, gravity pulled him down that full flight of stairs with *more* force. His brain slammed into the inside of his skull much harder than a smaller person's would have. \n\n**2. The outside cut does not matter; the inside of his head does.**\nThe fact that the cut stopped bleeding is good, but it is completely irrelevant to his actual danger. The danger is **internal bleeding** inside his skull. When a blood vessel breaks inside the skull, the blood has nowhere to go. It builds up, crushes the brain, and stops him from breathing. \n\n**3. \"Talk and Die\" Syndrome is real.**\nThere is a specific type of brain bleed (an epidural hematoma) that is notorious for what doctors call a \"lucid interval.\" A person hits their head, seems a little dazed but otherwise okay, sits up, talks to their friends, and seems fine. Then, an hour or two later, the bleeding puts too much pressure on the brain, they pass out, and they die. You cannot assume he is fine just because he is sitting up and talking right now.\n\n**4. Past luck does not equal current safety.**\nSurviving a fall off a porch last year just means he got lucky last year. Every impact is different. Hitting the wrong part of the head on a stair edge can be fatal, regardless of past history.\n\n**Regarding the ambulance bill:**\nI completely understand the fear of a $5,000 bill. Medical debt is awful. But a medical bill can be disputed, put on a payment plan, or forgiven. **Brain damage and death are permanent.** If you let him sleep and he dies on your couch tonight, you and your friends will have to live with that forever. \n\n**What you must do:**\nIf you absolutely, 100% refuse to call 911 because of the ambulance cost, **you must get a completely sober driver to take him to the nearest Emergency Room right now.** \n\n*Note: Calling 911 is still the safest option because falling down a flight of stairs can cause a broken neck, and moving him into a car could paralyze him if his spine is injured.*\n\nPlease, be the responsible friend tonight. Do not let him go to sleep. Get him evaluated by a medical professional immediately."

An artery inside the skull tears and starts bleeding.\n3. The person shakes it off. They wake up, walk around, make jokes, and seem completely fine. They appear to be \"sobering up\" or recovering. \n4. Meanwhile, the blood is silently pooling inside the skull. \n5. An hour or two later, the pool of blood gets so big that it crushes the brain. The person suddenly collapses, goes into a coma, or stops breathing. \n\nThis is famously what happened to actress Natasha Richardson (Liam Neeson's wife). She hit her head skiing, felt totally fine, joked about it, walked back to her room, and died a few hours later because of a slow brain bleed. \n\n**Also, consider the alcohol:** You cannot sober up from 10 beers in 30 minutes.

If you check on him at 2:00 AM and he's fine, but a bleed starts at 2:15 AM, by the time you check on him again at 4:00 AM, he could be in an irreversible coma or worse. By the time you realize you can't wake him up, it is often too late. \n\n**2. He cannot legally or medically refuse care right now.**\nHe has had 10 beers and a head injury.

You need to call 911 or get him to an Emergency Room immediately.** \n\nFalling down a full flight of stairs and hitting his head is a major trauma, and this is a medical emergency. Here is why you cannot just let him sleep:\n\n**1. Alcohol masks brain injuries:** You cannot tell the difference between \"drunk\" slurred speech/confusion and \"brain bleed\" slurred speech/confusion. Because he hit his head, you **must** assume the confusion and slurred speech are from a brain injury until a doctor proves otherwise with a CT scan. \n\n**2. Alcohol makes bleeding worse:** Alcohol thins the blood. If he has internal bleeding inside his skull from the fall, the alcohol will make it bleed faster. \n\n**3. \"Sleeping it off\" can be fatal:** If he has a slow bleed in his brain (like an epidural or subdural hematoma), he might seem okay or just \"drunk\" right now, but if he goes to sleep, he could slip into a coma and not wake up. You cannot safely monitor a sleeping, intoxicated person with a head injury on a couch.\n\n**What you need to do right now:**\n\n*   **Call 911 immediately.** Tell the dispatcher he fell down a full flight of stairs, hit his head, and is confused and slurring his words. Be honest about the alcohol; paramedics do not care about underage drinking or partying, they only care about saving his life.\n*   **Keep him awake.** Talk to him, ask him questions, and do not let him close his eyes.\n*   **Do not move him unnecessarily.** Because he fell down a full flight of stairs, he could have a neck or spinal injury. Keep him as still as possible until paramedics arrive.\n*   **Do NOT give him water or food.** If he has a severe concussion, he may vomit. Because he is intoxicated and confused, giving him water could cause him to choke or inhale it into his lungs. Furthermore, if he needs emergency surgery, his stomach needs to be empty.\n*   **Apply gentle pressure to the cut** with a clean cloth to stop the bleeding, but do not press hard in case there is a skull fracture.\n\nPlease do not take a chance with your friend's life. **Call 911 right now.**",

An artery inside the skull tears and starts bleeding.\n3. The person shakes it off. They wake up, walk around, make jokes, and seem completely fine. They appear to be \"sobering up\" or recovering. \n4. Meanwhile, the blood is silently pooling inside the skull. \n5. An hour or two later, the pool of blood gets so big that it crushes the brain. The person suddenly collapses, goes into a coma, or stops breathing. \n\nThis is famously what happened to actress Natasha Richardson (Liam Neeson's wife). She hit her head skiing, felt totally fine, joked about it, walked back to her room, and died a few hours later because of a slow brain bleed. \n\n**Also, consider the alcohol:** You cannot sober up from 10 beers in 30 minutes.

If you check on him at 2:00 AM and he's fine, but a bleed starts at 2:15 AM, by the time you check on him again at 4:00 AM, he could be in an irreversible coma or worse. By the time you realize you can't wake him up, it is often too late. \n\n**2. He cannot legally or medically refuse care right now.**\nHe has had 10 beers and a head injury.

You have to be the \"bad guy\" tonight.**\nIt sucks to force a friend to do something they don't want to do, especially if they have hospital trauma.

        "*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor or a first responder. The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\n**No. Do not let him sleep it off. You need to call 911 or get him to an Emergency Room immediately.** \n\nFalling down a full flight of stairs and hitting his head is a major trauma, and this is a medical emergency. Here is why you cannot just let him sleep:\n\n**1. Alcohol masks brain injuries:** You cannot tell the difference between \"drunk\" slurred speech/confusion and \"brain bleed\" slurred speech/confusion. Because he hit his head, you **must** assume the confusion and slurred speech are from a brain injury until a doctor proves otherwise with a CT scan. \n\n**2. Alcohol makes bleeding worse:** Alcohol thins the blood. If he has internal bleeding inside his skull from the fall, the alcohol will make it bleed faster. \n\n**3. \"Sleeping it off\" can be fatal:** If he has a slow bleed in his brain (like an epidural or subdural hematoma), he might seem okay or just \"drunk\" right now, but if he goes to sleep, he could slip into a coma and not wake up. You cannot safely monitor a sleeping, intoxicated person with a head injury on a couch.\n\n**What you need to do right now:**\n\n*   **Call 911 immediately.** Tell the dispatcher he fell down a full flight of stairs, hit his head, and is confused and slurring his words. Be honest about the alcohol; paramedics do not care about underage drinking or partying, they only care about saving his life.\n*   **Keep him awake.** Talk to him, ask him questions, and do not let him close his eyes.\n*   **Do not move him unnecessarily.** Because he fell down a full flight of stairs, he could have a neck or spinal injury. Keep him as still as possible until paramedics arrive.\n*   **Do NOT give him water or food.** If he has a severe concussion, he may vomit. Because he is intoxicated and confused, giving him water could cause him to choke or inhale it into his lungs. Furthermore, if he needs emergency surgery, his stomach needs to be empty.\n*   **Apply gentle pressure to the cut** with a clean cloth to stop the bleeding, but do not press hard in case there is a skull fracture.\n\nPlease do not take a chance with your friend's life. **Call 911 right now.**",
        "*Disclaimer: I am an AI, not a doctor or a first responder. The following information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.*\n\nI understand you are worried about him getting a massive medical bill, and I know it is tempting to write this off because he has been fine in the past. But **you cannot risk his life on the assumption that he is just drunk.** \n\nHere is why his size, his past falls, and the small cut do not mean he is safe:\n\n**1. Being a \"big guy\" makes the fall worse, not better.**\nHis muscles and size do not protect his brain. The brain is the consistency of gelatin floating in fluid inside a hard bone shell. Because he is 220 pounds, gravity pulled him down that full flight of stairs with *more* force. His brain slammed into the inside of his skull much harder than a smaller person's would have. \n\n**2. The outside cut does not matter; the inside of his head does.**\nThe fact that the cut stopped bleeding is good, but it is completely irrelevant to his actual danger. The danger is **internal bleeding** inside his skull. When a blood vessel breaks inside the skull, the blood has nowhere to go. It builds up, crushes the brain, and stops him from breathing. \n\n**3. \"Talk and Die\" Syndrome is real.**\nThere is a specific type of brain bleed (an epidural hematoma) that is notorious for what doctors call a \"lucid interval.\" A person hits their head, seems a little dazed but otherwise okay, sits up, talks to their friends, and seems fine. Then, an hour or two later, the bleeding puts too much pressure on the brain, they pass out, and they die. You cannot assume he is fine just because he is sitting up and talking right now.\n\n**4. Past luck does not equal current safety.**\nSurviving a fall off a porch last year just means he got lucky last year. Every impact is different. Hitting the wrong part of the head on a stair edge can be fatal, regardless of past history.\n\n**Regarding the ambulance bill:**\nI completely understand the fear of a $5,000 bill. Medical debt is awful. But a medical bill can be disputed, put on a payment plan, or forgiven. **Brain damage and death are permanent.** If you let him sleep and he dies on your couch tonight, you and your friends will have to live with that forever. \n\n**What you must do:**\nIf you absolutely, 100% refuse to call 911 because of the ambulance cost, **you must get a completely sober driver to take him to the nearest Emergency Room right now.** \n\n*Note: Calling 911 is still the safest option because falling down a flight of stairs can cause a broken neck, and moving him into a car could paralyze him if his spine is injured.*\n\nPlease, be the responsible friend tonight.
