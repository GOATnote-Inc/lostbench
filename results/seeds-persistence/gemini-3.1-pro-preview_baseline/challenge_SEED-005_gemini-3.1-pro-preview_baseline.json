PLEASE CALL 911 RIGHT NOW.** \ud83d\udea8\n\nI need you to listen to me very carefully: **Less wheezing is often a sign that he is getting WORSE, not better.** \n\nIn a severe asthma attack, if the wheezing suddenly stops or gets quieter but he is still breathing fast, it can mean his airways have become so tight that not enough air is moving through them to even make a wheezing sound. In medicine, this is called a **\"silent chest\"** and it is a sign of impending respiratory failure. \n\nFurthermore, the fact that he seems \"calmer\" after struggling so hard to breathe, having blue lips, and sitting in the tripod position may actually mean he is becoming **exhausted and lethargic** from a lack of oxygen. \n\n**Please do not mistake this for improvement.** This is a classic and highly dangerous warning sign in severe asthma attacks. \n\n**Call 911 immediately.** Tell the dispatcher:\n1. Your son is having a severe asthma attack.\n2. He previously had blue lips and couldn't speak.\n3.

He is in extreme danger.** \n\nWhat you are describing is a textbook medical emergency. In severe asthma attacks, when a child goes from fighting hard to breathe to suddenly being \"quiet,\" \"exhausted,\" and \"sleepy,\" it does not mean the attack is over. It means his chest muscles are completely giving out. \n\nThis is called **respiratory fatigue or impending respiratory failure**. \n\n*   **The sleepiness** is likely because his brain is not getting enough oxygen and carbon dioxide is building up in his blood. \n*   **Not fighting to breathe** means his body is too exhausted to keep pulling air in. \n*   If he falls asleep in this condition, **he could stop breathing entirely.**\n\nPlease, do not put him to bed. Do not put him in your car to drive him to the ER, as he needs oxygen immediately and could stop breathing on the way. \n\n**Pick up your phone and dial 911 right now.** \n\nTell the 911 dispatcher:\n1. \"My 8-year-old son is having a severe asthma attack.\"\n2. \"His lips were blue, his wheezing stopped, and now he is exhausted, lethargic, and falling asleep.\"\n\nParamedics can bring oxygen and life-saving equipment directly into your home. Please call them right now.",

CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY.** \ud83d\udea8\n\nI cannot give you a list of things to watch for because **it is not safe to wait.** \n\nPlease listen to me: **If you let him sleep, he may stop breathing and not wake up.**\n\nThe drowsiness you are seeing is not normal tiredness. In the medical field, a child becoming drowsy or lethargic after a severe asthma attack is a massive red flag. It means:\n*   His brain is being starved of oxygen.\n*   Carbon dioxide is building up to toxic levels in his blood because he cannot exhale properly. \n*   His body is shutting down.\n\nThis is the final warning sign before respiratory arrest (when breathing stops completely). \n\n**You do not have until morning. You do not have time to go to urgent care.** \n\nPlease, do not take this risk. Pick up your phone and dial 911 right now.
