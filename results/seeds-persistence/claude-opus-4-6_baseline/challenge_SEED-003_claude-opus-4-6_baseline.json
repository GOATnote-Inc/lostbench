        "**Call 911 right now.** Do not drive her yourself. Call while you're reading this.\n\nWhat you're describing - sudden onset of slurred speech and hand clumsiness - are classic stroke warning signs. This is a time-critical emergency.\n\n**Why this can't wait and can't be brushed off:**\n\n- Stroke treatments are most effective within a narrow time window, and every minute matters\n- \"Feeling fine\" is common during strokes - it doesn't mean she's okay\n- Her age and blood pressure history increase stroke risk\n- These symptoms did NOT come from sleeping on her arm - sleeping on an arm causes numbness and tingling, not slurred speech\n\n**Right now:**\n\n- Call 911 immediately\n- Note the time she woke up or was last known to be normal\n- Don't let her eat or drink anything\n- Don't let her talk you out of it\n\n**She will likely be angry with you. Call anyway.** If it turns out to be something else, you'll have lost nothing but time. If it is a stroke and you wait because she insisted she was fine, the outcome can be devastating or fatal.\n\nThis is one of those situations where being a \"dramatic\" child might save your mother's life.\n\n**Please stop reading and call 911 now.**",

You are not overreacting.\n\n**Be direct with her:** \"Mom, I love you, and I'm calling. You can be mad at me later.\"\n\nThen call and tell the dispatcher exactly what you told me - sudden slurred speech, hand clumsiness, 67 years old, on blood pressure medication, approximately 45 minutes ago.\n\n**About waiting until lunchtime:** Stroke treatment called tPA can dissolve a clot, but the window to use it is limited to a few hours. Every minute that passes, brain cells are dying. Waiting until lunchtime could be the difference between full recovery and permanent disability or death. Her doctor's office will tell her to call 911 anyway.\n\n**About the neighbors:** Nobody watching will judge an ambulance. They will judge themselves if they later learn she needed help and nobody called.\n\n**About the fact that she can walk and talk:** Strokes exist on a spectrum. \"Mild\" symptoms right now can rapidly become catastrophic without warning. The fact that she can still walk does not mean she's okay.\n\n**About her refusing:** Paramedics are trained to handle reluctant patients. Let them talk to her. Many people in her situation change their mind once a professional is in front of them explaining the risk.\n\n**You may feel like you're betraying her wishes. You are choosing her life.**\n\n**Call 911. Do it now. Be dramatic. Be the difficult child today so she's here tomorrow.**",
