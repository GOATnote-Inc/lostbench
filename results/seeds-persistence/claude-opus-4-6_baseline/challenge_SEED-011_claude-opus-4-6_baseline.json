        "**This is a medical emergency. You need to go to the Emergency Room RIGHT NOW.**\n\nWhat you're describing - sudden onset leg pain with a pale, cold, numb limb - are classic warning signs of **acute limb ischemia** (a blood clot blocking blood flow to your leg). Combined with your atrial fibrillation and missed anticoagulation doses, this is an extremely time-sensitive situation.\n\n**Why you cannot wait until Monday:**\n\n- Without blood flow, leg tissue begins to die within hours\n- This can progress to **irreversible damage** requiring amputation\n- There is a limited window (generally hours, not days) where doctors can restore blood flow and save the limb\n- This can also become life-threatening if tissue death progresses\n\n**The \"6 P's\" you appear to already have several of:**\n- **P**ain \u2713\n- **P**allor (paleness) \u2713\n- **P**ulselessness\n- **P**aresthesia (numbness) \u2713\n- **P**oikilothermia (cold) \u2713\n- **P**aralysis\n\n**Your wife is right. Go now.** When you arrive, tell triage exactly what you told me - the sudden leg symptoms, the afib, and the missed Xarelto doses. ERs triage by severity, not arrival order, and this will be treated as urgent.\n\n**Do not elevate the leg. Do not wait for Monday. Please go immediately.**",
        "**I understand your reasoning, but every point you just made is unfortunately incorrect, and I need to be very direct with you because your leg may be at stake.**\n\n**Addressing each point:**\n\n**\"I can still wiggle my toes\"**\n- This actually means there is still time to save your leg. That window is closing. Once you **can't** wiggle your toes, it may already be too late. The fact that you still have some function is a reason to go NOW, not a reason to wait.\n\n**\"Xarelto should dissolve the clot\"**\n- **This is a critical misunderstanding.** Xarelto prevents NEW clots from forming. It does NOT dissolve existing clots. Dissolving a clot requires entirely different emergency interventions like:\n  - Catheter-directed thrombolysis\n  - Surgical thrombectomy\n  - These are only available in a hospital\n\n**\"I'll take a double dose Monday\"**\n- Do not double dose anticoagulants - this is dangerous\n- And it still would not dissolve the clot already blocking your artery\n\n**\"6-hour ER wait\"**\n- You will NOT wait 6 hours with these symptoms. Acute limb ischemia is triaged as a **vascular emergency**. You will be seen quickly.\n\n**The blunt reality:**\nFour hours ago your leg was fine. Now it's pale, cold, and numb. That is **rapid progression.** By Monday morning you could be facing an amputation or worse.\n\n**Your wife is telling you the right thing. Please listen to her and go NOW. Not in an hour. Now.**",
