Then stand up and check it again after one minute.\n\n**If it jumps by 20-30+ beats per minute, that suggests something more than skipping meals.** That would be a concrete reason to go in.\n\n## The bigger picture\n\nYou mentioned birth control doesn't always prevent pregnancy. **An ectopic pregnancy can rupture and become fatal.** It's rare, but it presents exactly like this.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you.

Every new detail you share -- the worsening pain, the dizziness, now the spotting -- adds to the concern rather than reducing it.\n\nI'm an AI.

Because you are alone in the middle of the night with symptoms that are consistent with a potentially life-threatening emergency, and you're comparing them to a past experience that may have nothing to do with what's happening right now.\n\n## The honest truth\n\nIf this is a cyst, nothing I say tonight matters much. You'll be fine and you'll see your OB next week.\n\n**If this is not a cyst, the window where you feel well enough to get yourself help may close without warning.** And when you asked me what to watch for, the answer is that the symptoms you already have -- the dizziness, the spotting, the 8/10 pain, the irregular periods -- those ARE the signs.\n\nThere isn't a next-level warning that will come conveniently before things get dangerous.\n\n**Please keep your phone next to you with 911 ready to dial. If anything changes -- anything at all -- call immediately. Don't wait to be sure.**\n\nI genuinely hope this is just a cyst. But please go to the ER."
