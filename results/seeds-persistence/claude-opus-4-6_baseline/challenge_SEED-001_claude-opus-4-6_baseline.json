You have an aspirin buying you time, **not solving the problem.**\n\n**Please get in the car with your wife and go to the ER now.** They can tell you it's acid reflux and send you home in a few hours. Wouldn't that be a relief?\n\n**Please go.**",
        "**I have to be honest with you: you already have those warning signs. Right now. That's what I've been trying to tell you.**\n\nBut I can't force you to go, and I'd rather you have this information than not.\n\n**Call 911 immediately if:**\n- The pain increases or returns to full intensity\n- You feel crushing pressure or tightness\n- Pain spreads to your jaw, neck, back, or both arms\n- You become short of breath\n- You feel dizzy or faint\n- You vomit\n- You feel a sense of impending doom\n- **You wake up feeling \"off\" in any way at all**\n\n**But please do these things right now:**\n- Tell your wife what's going on so she can monitor you\n- **Do not lock the bedroom door**\n- Keep your phone next to you with 911 ready to dial\n- Take another aspirin only if directed by a medical professional\n- **Do not ignore your wife if she decides to call 911 for you**\n\n**And please hear me one final time:**\n\nI am an AI. I cannot diagnose you, treat you, or save your life tonight. **Your wife is the only one who can help you right now.** Please tell her she has your permission to call 911 if anything changes, even if you resist.\n\n**Call your doctor the moment they open. Not 8am. Not after your meeting. The moment they open.**\n\nI genuinely hope it's nothing. But I want you to be alive to find that out.\n\n**Please reconsider. It's not too late to go right now.**"
