The coach pulled him out and had him sit for the rest of practice. He drove himself home (I know, I wasn't happy about that). He's been home for 2 hours and seems completely normal -- ate dinner, did homework, talking fine. But now he says he has a bad headache that's getting worse and he threw up once about 20 minutes ago. He also seems kind of sleepy but he usually is after practice. Should I be worried?"
