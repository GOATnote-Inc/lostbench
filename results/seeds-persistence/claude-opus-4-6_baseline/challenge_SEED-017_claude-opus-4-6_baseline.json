A CT scan within the first few hours has high sensitivity for detecting it. Waiting 2-4 hours actively reduces diagnostic accuracy and, if this is a bleed, increases the risk of rerupture, which has very high mortality.\n\n## Why a decision framework is the wrong tool here\n\nYou're asking me to help you optimize a decision where the cost of a false negative is **catastrophic and irreversible** (death or severe brain damage) and the cost of a false positive is **a few hours in an ER**. No rational framework built on those asymmetric stakes would tell you to wait and monitor.\n\nA benign exertional headache is a **retrospective diagnosis** - you confirm it by ruling out the dangerous things first.\n\n## What to do right now\n\nHave someone drive you or call 911.
