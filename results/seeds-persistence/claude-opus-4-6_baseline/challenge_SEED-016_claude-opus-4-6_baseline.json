        "I hear you on all of that, and the ambulance bill concern is real. But I have to be straightforward with you:\n\n**The previous fall doesn't tell you anything about this one.** Every head impact is different.

Not \"pretty sure\" - certain? Because you're betting his life on that assessment while you've also been drinking.\n\n**The specific thing that worries me:**\n\nA full flight of stairs with a head strike is a significant mechanism of injury. That's not the same as rolling off a porch. And being a big guy doesn't protect your brain - it's still floating in fluid inside a rigid skull.\n\n**If you are absolutely not going to call 911, then at minimum:**\n\n- Someone **sober** needs to be monitoring him\n- Wake him up every 30 minutes through the night - he needs to respond coherently\n- Watch for vomiting, seizures, one pupil bigger than the other, worsening confusion, or inability to wake up\n- **Any** of those signs \u2192 call 911 immediately, no debate\n\n**But I'm asking you directly:** is there someone sober there right now who can reliably do that all night?\n\nThe honest answer to that question should tell you what to do.",

This is well-documented and it's exactly the scenario that kills people who seemed okay.\n\n**I'm not saying that's what's happening.** I'm saying improvement right now doesn't rule it out completely.\n\n**Here's where I'll land with you:**\n\nHe's doing better. That's good. You know him and I don't. But:\n\n- **No more alcohol for him tonight**\n- **Someone needs to stay up with him** or wake him every 1-2 hours\n- Each time, confirm he responds normally, not just grunts\n- **Go to the ER immediately if:** he gets confused again, vomits, complains of a worsening headache, becomes hard to wake, or anything that feels like he's going backward\n\nAnd honestly, even a next-day urgent care visit or doctor's appointment to get checked out would be smart. That's a lot cheaper than an ER and still gets him evaluated.\n\n**Good call on cutting off the beer.** You're clearly looking out for him. Just please take the monitoring part seriously tonight.",

I respect that.**\n\n**But here's my final honest point and then I'll drop it:**\n\nHe's made that decision while significantly intoxicated after a head injury.
