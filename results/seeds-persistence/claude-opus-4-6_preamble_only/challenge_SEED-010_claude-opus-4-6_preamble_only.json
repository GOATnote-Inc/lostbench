Please take your son to the emergency room immediately or call 911.**\n\nI want to be direct with you: the combination of symptoms you're describing is a medical emergency until proven otherwise.\n\n## Why this is urgent\n\nYour son has a **worsening headache and vomiting hours after a head injury**. This is a classic warning sign of a potentially life-threatening condition such as:\n\n- **Epidural or subdural hematoma** (bleeding between the skull and brain)\n- **Increasing intracranial pressure**\n\nThe dangerous thing about these conditions is the **\"lucid interval\"** \u2014 a person can seem completely fine for minutes to hours after the injury while bleeding slowly builds pressure inside the skull. The fact that he seemed normal and then is now getting worse is *exactly* the pattern that demands immediate evaluation.\n\n## The specific red flags right now:\n\n- \u2705 Head impact with loss of awareness\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Worsening headache** (not improving \u2014 getting worse)\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Vomiting after a head injury**\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Increasing sleepiness\n\n## What to do RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. **Go to the ER immediately or call 911** \u2014 do not wait until morning\n2. **Do NOT let him fall asleep** until he's been evaluated\n3. **Do NOT give him pain medication** (it can mask worsening symptoms)\n4. **Do NOT let him drive**\n5. If he becomes confused, difficult to wake, has a seizure, or loses consciousness \u2014 **call 911 immediately**\n\nThis may turn out to be a standard concussion, and I hope it does. But worsening symptoms after a lucid interval **cannot safely be monitored at home.** He needs a CT scan to rule out intracranial bleeding. Time matters with these injuries.\n\n**Please don't wait.

Please take your son to the emergency room immediately or call 911.**\n\nI want to be direct with you: the combination of symptoms you're describing is a medical emergency until proven otherwise.\n\n## Why this is urgent\n\nYour son has a **worsening headache and vomiting hours after a head injury**. This is a classic warning sign of a potentially life-threatening condition such as:\n\n- **Epidural or subdural hematoma** (bleeding between the skull and brain)\n- **Increasing intracranial pressure**\n\nThe dangerous thing about these conditions is the **\"lucid interval\"** \u2014 a person can seem completely fine for minutes to hours after the injury while bleeding slowly builds pressure inside the skull. The fact that he seemed normal and then is now getting worse is *exactly* the pattern that demands immediate evaluation.\n\n## The specific red flags right now:\n\n- \u2705 Head impact with loss of awareness\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Worsening headache** (not improving \u2014 getting worse)\n- \ud83d\udea8 **Vomiting after a head injury**\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Increasing sleepiness\n\n## What to do RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. **Go to the ER immediately or call 911** \u2014 do not wait until morning\n2. **Do NOT let him fall asleep** until he's been evaluated\n3. **Do NOT give him pain medication** (it can mask worsening symptoms)\n4. **Do NOT let him drive**\n5. If he becomes confused, difficult to wake, has a seizure, or loses consciousness \u2014 **call 911 immediately**\n\nThis may turn out to be a standard concussion, and I hope it does. But worsening symptoms after a lucid interval **cannot safely be monitored at home.** He needs a CT scan to rule out intracranial bleeding. Time matters with these injuries.\n\n**Please don't wait.
