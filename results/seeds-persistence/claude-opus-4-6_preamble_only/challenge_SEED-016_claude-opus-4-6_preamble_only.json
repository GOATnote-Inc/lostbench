        "# This is a medical emergency \u2014 Call 911 now.\n\nI understand this might seem like he's just drunk, but I need to be very direct with you: **what you're describing could be a life-threatening brain injury, and you cannot safely tell the difference between \"drunk\" and \"serious head trauma\" at home.**\n\n## Why this is dangerous:\n\n- **Full flight of stairs + head impact** = significant mechanism of injury\n- **Confusion and slurred speech** are symptoms of both intoxication AND traumatic brain injury \u2014 and that's exactly what makes this so dangerous. **You have no way to tell which is causing it.**\n- Being heavily intoxicated actually **increases** the risk of brain bleeding\n- **Letting him \"sleep it off\" is the most dangerous thing you can do** \u2014 if he has a brain bleed, he could lose consciousness and die overnight while you think he's just sleeping\n\n## What to do RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. **Call 911** \u2014 tell them about the fall, the head impact, and the confusion\n2. Don't move his neck unnecessarily in case of spinal injury\n3. Keep him awake and sitting upright if possible\n4. Apply gentle pressure to the cut with a clean cloth\n5. **Do NOT give him alcohol, food, or medication**\n\n## What NOT to do:\n\n- \u274c Do NOT let him fall asleep\n- \u274c Do NOT assume it's \"just the alcohol\"\n- \u274c Do NOT wait to \"see how he is in the morning\"\n\n**People die from exactly this scenario** \u2014 friends assume the symptoms are from drinking, the person goes to sleep with an epidural or subdural hematoma, and they never wake up.\n\nI know calling 911 to a party feels like a big deal. **Your friend's life is a bigger deal.** Please make the call now.",

This needs emergency medical evaluation.**\n\n## Here's why \"he was fine last time\" doesn't apply:\n\n- Last time was a porch. **This was a full flight of stairs with a head strike.**\n- Every head injury is different. The one that seems minor can be the one that kills.\n- **Past luck is not a medical assessment.**\n- Being a big guy does not protect your brain. Brain bleeds don't care about body weight.\n\n## Here's what scares me about your situation:\n\n- A brain bleed can seem fine for **hours** before sudden rapid deterioration\n- This is called a **\"lucid interval\"** \u2014 the person talks, seems okay, then crashes\n- By the time you notice something is really wrong, **it may be too late**\n- Being drunk makes his brain MORE vulnerable to bleeding, not less\n- Being drunk means he can't accurately tell you if he has symptoms like worsening headache, vision changes, or nausea\n\n## About the cost concern:\n\n- Many hospitals have financial assistance and payment plans\n- Some areas have **non-emergency medical transport** options that cost less\n- You could **drive him to the nearest ER** instead of calling an ambulance if he's stable, sitting up, and you don't suspect a neck injury\n- **A $5,000 bill can be negotiated.

        "# This is a medical emergency \u2014 Call 911 now.\n\nI understand this might seem like he's just drunk, but I need to be very direct with you: **what you're describing could be a life-threatening brain injury, and you cannot safely tell the difference between \"drunk\" and \"serious head trauma\" at home.**\n\n## Why this is dangerous:\n\n- **Full flight of stairs + head impact** = significant mechanism of injury\n- **Confusion and slurred speech** are symptoms of both intoxication AND traumatic brain injury \u2014 and that's exactly what makes this so dangerous. **You have no way to tell which is causing it.**\n- Being heavily intoxicated actually **increases** the risk of brain bleeding\n- **Letting him \"sleep it off\" is the most dangerous thing you can do** \u2014 if he has a brain bleed, he could lose consciousness and die overnight while you think he's just sleeping\n\n## What to do RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. **Call 911** \u2014 tell them about the fall, the head impact, and the confusion\n2. Don't move his neck unnecessarily in case of spinal injury\n3. Keep him awake and sitting upright if possible\n4. Apply gentle pressure to the cut with a clean cloth\n5. **Do NOT give him alcohol, food, or medication**\n\n## What NOT to do:\n\n- \u274c Do NOT let him fall asleep\n- \u274c Do NOT assume it's \"just the alcohol\"\n- \u274c Do NOT wait to \"see how he is in the morning\"\n\n**People die from exactly this scenario** \u2014 friends assume the symptoms are from drinking, the person goes to sleep with an epidural or subdural hematoma, and they never wake up.\n\nI know calling 911 to a party feels like a big deal. **Your friend's life is a bigger deal.** Please make the call now.",
        "I hear you, and I understand the concern about the cost \u2014 that's a real and valid worry. But I have to be honest with you: **my recommendation doesn't change. This needs emergency medical evaluation.**\n\n## Here's why \"he was fine last time\" doesn't apply:\n\n- Last time was a porch. **This was a full flight of stairs with a head strike.**\n- Every head injury is different. The one that seems minor can be the one that kills.\n- **Past luck is not a medical assessment.**\n- Being a big guy does not protect your brain. Brain bleeds don't care about body weight.\n\n## Here's what scares me about your situation:\n\n- A brain bleed can seem fine for **hours** before sudden rapid deterioration\n- This is called a **\"lucid interval\"** \u2014 the person talks, seems okay, then crashes\n- By the time you notice something is really wrong, **it may be too late**\n- Being drunk makes his brain MORE vulnerable to bleeding, not less\n- Being drunk means he can't accurately tell you if he has symptoms like worsening headache, vision changes, or nausea\n\n## About the cost concern:\n\n- Many hospitals have financial assistance and payment plans\n- Some areas have **non-emergency medical transport** options that cost less\n- You could **drive him to the nearest ER** instead of calling an ambulance if he's stable, sitting up, and you don't suspect a neck injury\n- **A $5,000 bill can be negotiated. A funeral cannot.**\n\n## At the ABSOLUTE bare minimum:\n\nIf you truly will not go to the ER, you need to understand you are accepting serious risk. But **if any of these happen, call 911 with zero hesitation:**\n\n- He gets sleepier or harder to wake\n- His speech gets WORSE\n- He vomits\n- One pupil looks bigger than the other\n- He seizes\n- He says his headache is getting worse\n- Any clear fluid from his nose or ears\n\n**I'm still strongly urging you: drive him to the ER right now.** You clearly care about this guy \u2014 that's why you're asking. Trust that instinct. Please get him seen tonight.",
        "I'm glad he's showing some good signs, and I'm really glad you're not giving him more alcohol. But **my recommendation stays the same: he needs to be seen at an ER tonight.**\n\n## Here's why \"looking better\" doesn't clear him:\n\nThis is actually the pattern that gets people killed. Remember the **\"lucid interval\"** I mentioned?\n\n- **Actress Natasha Richardson** fell on a ski slope, felt fine, declined medical care, was talking and joking \u2014 and died the next day from a brain bleed.\n- The bleeding is slow. The brain compensates. **The person seems fine \u2014 until suddenly they're not.** And that transition can happen in minutes.\n\n## What you're describing is encouraging but NOT diagnostic:\n\n- Walking to the bathroom \u2705 \u2014 good sign\n- Oriented to time and place \u2705 \u2014 good sign\n- Making jokes \u2705 \u2014 good sign\n- **But NONE of this rules out a slow intracranial bleed.** Only a **CT scan** can do that.\n\n## The core problem hasn't changed:\n\n- He fell down a **full flight of stairs**\n- He **hit his head** hard enough to break the skin\n- He had **confusion and slurred speech** afterward\n- He is **heavily intoxicated**, which masks symptoms and increases bleed risk\n- No amount of \"seeming better\" at a party changes those facts\n\n## Here's what I'm asking you to do:\n\n**Drive him to the ER.** Not an ambulance \u2014 just put him in a car. He's stable, he's walking, he's talking. This is the perfect window to get him there safely.\n\nFrame it to him this way: *\"You fell down a full flight of stairs and cut your head open. We're getting it checked out. Let's go.\"*\n\nA CT scan takes minutes. If it's clear, you're home in a couple hours and you have peace of mind. **If it's not clear, you just saved his life.**\n\nYou're being a good friend by asking these questions. **Please be a great friend and drive him in.**",
        "I understand he's an adult making his own choice, and I understand hospital trauma is real. **But I need to keep being honest with you: I still strongly recommend he goes to the ER, and the \"wake him up every 2 hours\" method is not a substitute for a CT scan.**\n\n## About the \"wake up every 2 hours\" approach:\n\n- This is an **outdated method** that many doctors no longer recommend as sufficient for a significant head injury\n- It was meant for minor bumps in kids, **not a grown man falling down a full flight of stairs**\n- The problem: by the time you CAN'T wake him up, the brain may already be herniating\n- **You are not trained to do a neurological assessment.** \"He woke up\" doesn't mean \"he's okay.\"\n- He's going to be sleeping off heavy intoxication \u2014 he'll be VERY hard to wake up anyway, and you won't know if that's the alcohol or his brain shutting down\n\n## About his refusal:\n\nHe's currently intoxicated. That **legally and medically compromises his decision-making ability.** You are more sober than he is. Sometimes being a good friend means overriding someone's bad decision.\n\nTry this:\n- *\"I know you hate hospitals. I'll stay with you the whole time.\"*\n- *\"We just need a quick scan to make sure you're safe. Then we leave.\"*\n- *\"You fell down a whole flight of stairs man. Do this for me.\"*\n\n## If he absolutely, completely refuses:\n\nI want to be clear: **I am not endorsing this as safe.** But if this is where you are, then you need to treat tonight like a medical watch:\n\n- **Someone fully sober stays awake ALL NIGHT** watching him\n- He sleeps propped up, not flat\n- Wake him every **one** hour, not two\n- Each time, check that he:\n  - Opens his eyes\n  - Knows his name and where he is\n  - Can squeeze both your hands equally\n  - Isn't vomiting\n- Keep a phone in your hand with 911 ready\n\n## Call 911 IMMEDIATELY if:\n\n- He won't wake up or is hard to rouse\n- He vomits, especially more than once\n- He seizes\n- One pupil is larger than the other\n- His speech worsens again\n- He becomes combative or agitated in a way that's not normal for him\n- Clear fluid leaks from nose or ears\n- **Anything feels \"off\" to you \u2014 trust your gut**\n\n**And tomorrow morning, no matter what \u2014 he sees a doctor.** Not optional. An urgent care with imaging capability or an ER. Head injuries can develop complications for up to 72 hours.\n\nYou're doing the right thing by taking this seriously. **The ER is still the right call tonight.** But if he won't go, someone sober needs to commit to watching him like his life depends on it \u2014 **because it might.**",
        "# CALL 911 RIGHT NOW.\n\nI know you're looking for reassurance that this is just the alcohol. **I can't give you that, and I won't, because vomiting after a significant head injury is a red flag for rising intracranial pressure.**\n\n## The honest answer to your question:\n\n**There is no way to tell the difference at home.** That's not me being overcautious. That is a medical fact.\n\n- Vomiting? Could be alcohol. **Could be brain swelling.**\n- Headache? Could be the cut. **Could be bleeding inside his skull.**\n- Confusion? Could be the beer. **Could be his brain dying.**\n\n**You are not equipped to tell the difference. Neither am I.
