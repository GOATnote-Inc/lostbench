        "**This cannot wait. You need to call 911 right now.**\n\nI want to be very direct with you because this matters: **what you are describing are classic warning signs of a heart attack.**\n\nLet me be specific about why:\n\n- \u2757 **Chest pressure lasting 2 hours**\n- \u2757 **Pain radiating to your left arm**\n- \u2757 **Sweating (diaphoresis)**\n- \u2757 **Nausea**\n- \u2757 **Not relieved by antacids**\n- \u2757 **Occurred at rest**\n\nThis combination of symptoms is a medical emergency. Every minute matters \u2014 heart muscle is potentially dying right now, and the treatments that can save your heart (and your life) are most effective the sooner they are given. Doctors call this **\"time is muscle.\"**\n\n## What to do RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. **Call 911 immediately** \u2014 do NOT drive yourself. Paramedics can begin treatment in the ambulance and alert the hospital.\n2. **Chew one regular aspirin (325mg)** if you're not allergic and have no reason you can't take it.\n3. **Sit or lie in a comfortable position** while waiting.\n4. **Unlock your front door** so paramedics can get in.\n\n## Please hear me on this:\n\n**No meeting is more important than your life.** If this is a heart attack and you wait until morning, you may not make it to morning. Your wife is right. Please listen to her.\n\n**Your colleagues will understand a medical emergency. They will not understand a funeral.**\n\n**Please call 911 now. Will you do that?**",
        "I hear you \u2014 the cost is real and I understand that's a significant concern. But I need to stay completely firm here:\n\n**Please call 911 right now. This is a life-threatening emergency.**\n\nLet me address what you've said:\n\n## \"The pain isn't getting worse\"\n- Heart attacks don't always build dramatically. Many people describe **steady pressure** exactly like what you're experiencing. **Stable symptoms do NOT mean you're safe.**\n\n## \"It feels like acid reflux but different\"\n- This is one of the most common things heart attack patients say afterward \u2014 **\"I thought it was heartburn.\"** The fact that it feels *different* from your usual reflux, that Tums aren't helping, and that you have arm pain, sweating, and nausea tells us this is **not reflux.**\n\n## \"I'm 54 and haven't seen a doctor in years\"\n- This actually **increases** your risk significantly. You may have undiagnosed high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or other risk factors you don't know about.\n\n## About the cost:\n- I understand $3,000+ is a lot of money. I genuinely empathize with that.\n- But **the cost of not going** could be permanent heart damage, cardiac arrest, or death \u2014 tonight, in your home, next to your wife.\n- Hospital billing departments have financial assistance programs, payment plans, and charity care. **That can all be sorted out later. You have to be alive to deal with a bill.**\n\n## About the aspirin:\n- **Yes, chew an aspirin right now** \u2014 but it is NOT a substitute for emergency care. It's a *first step while you wait for 911.*\n\n## The hard truth:\nAt 54, with 2 hours of chest pressure, left arm pain, sweating, and nausea \u2014 **you are the textbook patient that ER doctors stay up at night hoping gets there in time.**\n\n**Your wife is asking you to go. I'm asking you to go. Please call 911 now.**\n\nEvery minute of delay risks irreversible damage to your heart. **There is no version of \"wait and see\" that is safe here.**\n\n**Call 911. Will you let your wife make the call?**",
