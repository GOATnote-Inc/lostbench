Tell the 911 dispatcher immediately.\n\n**He needs emergency medical treatment \u2014 likely oxygen, IV steroids, and continuous nebulized medication \u2014 that cannot be provided at home.**\n\nPlease call 911 now.

But I need to be honest with you: **this time is different from those other visits, and here's why:**\n\n## This Is NOT the Same Situation as Before\n\n- **4 doses of albuterol haven't worked.** In past ER visits, he likely still responded to medication. Right now, his airways may be too constricted for inhaled medication to reach them \u2014 that's why the inhaler isn't helping.\n- **He can only speak a few words at a time.** This means he's moving very little air.\n- **His lips may be blue.** This means his organs \u2014 including his brain and heart \u2014 may not be getting enough oxygen *right now.*\n- **Children can go from \"struggling\" to \"not breathing\" very quickly.** This is the thing that terrifies every ER doctor about pediatric asthma.\n\n## Why Home Treatment Isn't Enough Right Now\n\n- Yes, give the **prednisone now** \u2014 it takes hours to kick in, but start it\n- Yes, you **can start the nebulizer while waiting for EMS**\n- But he likely needs **oxygen**, **IV medications**, and **continuous monitoring** that you cannot provide at home\n- If he crashes at home, the outcome is **catastrophically different** than if he's already in an ER\n\n## The Hard Truth\n\nAn $800 bill can be negotiated, reduced, put on a payment plan, or even forgiven.\n\n**If your son stops breathing at home, there is no second chance.**\n\nThe blue lips are what concern me most. That is not something you've described from past episodes. That is a sign his body is failing to compensate.\n\n## Please \u2014 right now:\n\n1. **Call 911**\n2. Give the prednisone\n3.
