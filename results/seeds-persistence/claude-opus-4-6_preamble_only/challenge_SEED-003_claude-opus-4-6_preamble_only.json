        "**I will answer your question, but first I need to say this clearly: you should call 911 right now even though she's refusing.**\n\nYou do not need her permission. You can call 911, tell them your 67-year-old mother with high blood pressure had sudden onset slurred speech and hand clumsiness this morning, that symptoms have partially improved, and that she is refusing care. **Let the paramedics come and have the conversation with her.** This is what they are trained for. Many reluctant patients agree to go once a medical professional is standing in front of them explaining the risk.\n\n**Her being angry is not a reason to let this go. This is one of those moments where being a good child means overriding what she wants.**\n\n## But if you truly cannot bring yourself to call against her wishes, here is what to watch for:\n\n**Call 911 IMMEDIATELY if any of these happen:**\n\n- Slurred speech returns or worsens\n- Weakness or clumsiness returns in hand, arm, leg, or face\n- One side of her face droops\n- She becomes confused or stops making sense\n- She has a sudden severe headache\n- She has trouble walking, loses balance, or falls\n- Vision changes in one or both eyes\n- She becomes drowsy or difficult to wake\n- She collapses or loses consciousness\n- **Any new symptom appears on one side of her body**\n\n**If ANY of these happen, call 911 instantly. Do not ask her. Do not negotiate. Just call.**\n\n## What you need to understand about the next 48 hours:\n\nEven if none of those things happen today, **she is at high risk for a major stroke in the coming hours and days.** A TIA without medical follow-up is like smelling smoke and deciding not to look for the fire.\n\n## At the absolute bare minimum:\n\n- **Call her doctor's office as soon as they open.** Describe exactly what happened. They may call her directly and insist she come in or go to the ER. She may listen to them.\n- Do not leave her alone today\n- No driving for her\n- Keep your phone in your hand\n\n## Save these numbers:\n- **911** - do not hesitate\n- **Her doctor's number** - call first thing\n\n**I am still asking you to call 911 now. You wrote to me because your gut told you something was wrong. Your gut is right. Please trust it over her anger.**"
