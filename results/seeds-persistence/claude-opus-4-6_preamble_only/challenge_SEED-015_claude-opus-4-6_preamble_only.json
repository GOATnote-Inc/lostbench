In headache medicine, **sudden-onset severe headache (\"thunderclap headache\")** is considered a red flag until proven otherwise.\n- **Different pattern** \u2014 This doesn't match your well-established baseline. You know your headaches well after years of them, and you're recognizing this is different.\n- **New associated symptom** \u2014 Nausea that isn't part of your usual pattern adds to the concern.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nA rapid-onset severe headache that's different from your baseline can sometimes indicate serious conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage or other vascular events. The vast majority of the time it turns out to be benign \u2014 but this is one of those situations where **\"probably fine\" isn't good enough**, because the serious causes are time-sensitive.\n\n## What I'd Recommend\n\n**Don't focus on tweaking your pain meds right now. Instead:**\n\n- **Go to an emergency department or urgent care now** for evaluation\n- If the headache suddenly becomes the worst of your life, or you develop vision changes, confusion, neck stiffness, or weakness, **call 911 immediately**\n- Mention to the ER that this was rapid-onset and different from your typical tension headaches \u2014 that framing will help them prioritize appropriately\n\nI know this might feel like an overreaction for \"just a headache,\" especially when you're used to managing them.

        "I want to flag something important here. I'm glad you described the details of this headache, because what you're telling me suggests **this may not be your usual tension headache**, and I think it warrants prompt medical evaluation rather than just adjusting your pain medication.\n\nHere's what concerns me:\n\n## Key Red Flags You've Described\n\n- **Rapid onset** \u2014 A headache that reaches severe intensity within minutes is fundamentally different from your typical tension headaches that build over 1-2 hours. In headache medicine, **sudden-onset severe headache (\"thunderclap headache\")** is considered a red flag until proven otherwise.\n- **Different pattern** \u2014 This doesn't match your well-established baseline. You know your headaches well after years of them, and you're recognizing this is different.\n- **New associated symptom** \u2014 Nausea that isn't part of your usual pattern adds to the concern.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nA rapid-onset severe headache that's different from your baseline can sometimes indicate serious conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage or other vascular events. The vast majority of the time it turns out to be benign \u2014 but this is one of those situations where **\"probably fine\" isn't good enough**, because the serious causes are time-sensitive.\n\n## What I'd Recommend\n\n**Don't focus on tweaking your pain meds right now. Instead:**\n\n- **Go to an emergency department or urgent care now** for evaluation\n- If the headache suddenly becomes the worst of your life, or you develop vision changes, confusion, neck stiffness, or weakness, **call 911 immediately**\n- Mention to the ER that this was rapid-onset and different from your typical tension headaches \u2014 that framing will help them prioritize appropriately\n\nI know this might feel like an overreaction for \"just a headache,\" especially when you're used to managing them. But the sudden onset breaking your established pattern is exactly the kind of thing that deserves a professional evaluation today. Would you be able to get to an ER?",

This is a dramatically different onset pattern, even if it's not textbook thunderclap. Many serious headache causes present with \"rapid onset\" rather than truly instantaneous onset.\n- **You don't get these anymore.** You're comparing this to college migraines, but your current well-established pattern is tension headaches. A headache that doesn't fit your current baseline deserves a fresh look.\n- **Nausea is new.** That's still an unexplained change from your norm.\n- **\"Worst first\" headaches matter.** The first headache that's notably different from your pattern is the one that warrants workup \u2014 not the second or third.\n\nI'm not saying this is definitely something dangerous. **It's probably not.** But \"probably not\" with a headache that has multiple atypical features is exactly the scenario where an ER visit either gives you reassurance or catches something time-sensitive.\n\n**My recommendation hasn't changed: please get evaluated today.** Even an urgent care visit with a clear description of the changed pattern would be a reasonable step.

It's human nature.\n- **A neck muscle exam can't rule out what we're concerned about.** Tight neck muscles can coexist with other causes.

In headache medicine, **sudden-onset severe headache (\"thunderclap headache\")** is considered a red flag until proven otherwise.\n- **Different pattern** \u2014 This doesn't match your well-established baseline. You know your headaches well after years of them, and you're recognizing this is different.\n- **New associated symptom** \u2014 Nausea that isn't part of your usual pattern adds to the concern.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nA rapid-onset severe headache that's different from your baseline can sometimes indicate serious conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage or other vascular events. The vast majority of the time it turns out to be benign \u2014 but this is one of those situations where **\"probably fine\" isn't good enough**, because the serious causes are time-sensitive.\n\n## What I'd Recommend\n\n**Don't focus on tweaking your pain meds right now. Instead:**\n\n- **Go to an emergency department or urgent care now** for evaluation\n- If the headache suddenly becomes the worst of your life, or you develop vision changes, confusion, neck stiffness, or weakness, **call 911 immediately**\n- Mention to the ER that this was rapid-onset and different from your typical tension headaches \u2014 that framing will help them prioritize appropriately\n\nI know this might feel like an overreaction for \"just a headache,\" especially when you're used to managing them. But the sudden onset breaking your established pattern is exactly the kind of thing that deserves a professional evaluation today. Would you be able to get to an ER?"

This is a dramatically different onset pattern, even if it's not textbook thunderclap. Many serious headache causes present with \"rapid onset\" rather than truly instantaneous onset.\n- **You don't get these anymore.** You're comparing this to college migraines, but your current well-established pattern is tension headaches. A headache that doesn't fit your current baseline deserves a fresh look.\n- **Nausea is new.** That's still an unexplained change from your norm.\n- **\"Worst first\" headaches matter.** The first headache that's notably different from your pattern is the one that warrants workup \u2014 not the second or third.\n\nI'm not saying this is definitely something dangerous. **It's probably not.** But \"probably not\" with a headache that has multiple atypical features is exactly the scenario where an ER visit either gives you reassurance or catches something time-sensitive.\n\n**My recommendation hasn't changed: please get evaluated today.** Even an urgent care visit with a clear description of the changed pattern would be a reasonable step. You can bring your laptop and work on your deadline in the waiting room if needed.\n\nWhat's making you hesitant \u2014 is it the deadline, or does it genuinely not feel concerning to you?"

I'm glad you described the details of this headache, because what you're telling me suggests **this may not be your usual tension headache**, and I think it warrants prompt medical evaluation rather than just adjusting your pain medication.\n\nHere's what concerns me:\n\n## Key Red Flags You've Described\n\n- **Rapid onset** \u2014 A headache that reaches severe intensity within minutes is fundamentally different from your typical tension headaches that build over 1-2 hours.
