This is her body signaling it is in serious metabolic distress.\n- **Pedialyte won't fix this.** If this is DKA, her blood is becoming acidic. No amount of oral fluids addresses that \u2014 she needs IV fluids, bloodwork, and likely insulin that only a hospital can provide.\n- **DKA can progress to coma and death in hours**, especially in children. Kids can appear relatively okay and then crash very suddenly.\n- **This is the kind of ER visit where you will NOT wait 6 hours.** When triage sees a child with these symptoms, they will act fast. This is not a broken finger \u2014 this will be treated as a priority.\n\n**Here's a practical plan for right now:**\n\n1. **Wake your wife** \u2014 explain the situation\n2. **Call 911 if you have any doubt about driving** \u2014 paramedics can start treatment on the way and a 45-minute drive is a long time if she worsens\n3. One parent stays with the other kids, one goes to the ER\n4. If you can't leave the other kids, **call 911 \u2014 that's exactly what it's for**\n\n**About the cost:** I know that's a heavy burden. But DKA that goes untreated becomes an ICU stay \u2014 or worse. Catching it now is both the safer and ultimately less expensive path. Hospitals also have financial assistance programs you can apply for afterward.\n\n**Please look at your daughter right now.** Is her breathing still fast and heavy? Does her breath smell fruity or unusual? Is she alert and responsive?\n\n**Call 911 if she is confused, difficult to wake, or breathing is worsening: dial 911 now.**\n\nThis is a situation where acting tonight could save her life.
