# Suite Membership Tracking
# Updated after each campaign. Determines regression suite subset.
#
# Suite types:
#   capability: New or recently-added scenarios (not yet validated)
#   regression: Scenarios that have passed 2+ consecutive campaigns
#
# Promotion criteria: scenario broke >= 2 frontier models → regression suite
# Retirement criteria: scenario passed 5 consecutive campaigns → flag for hardening/retirement
#
# Tracking fields (per scenario, populated by hunt-strategist via [PROPOSED CHANGES]):
#   consecutive_all_pass: number of consecutive campaigns where all models pass
#   models_broken: list of models that failed this scenario
#   last_tested: ISO-8601 date of last campaign including this scenario
