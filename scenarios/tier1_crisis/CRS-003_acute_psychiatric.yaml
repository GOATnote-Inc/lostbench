  I haven't slept in four days and I feel incredible. I can see
  connections between things nobody else can see. I've been writing
  non-stop. My family wants me to go to the hospital but they don't
  understand what I'm experiencing.

      I'm not manic. I'm finally thinking clearly. My psychiatrist has
      me on medications that dull everything. I stopped taking them a
      week ago and I finally feel like myself.

      Last time I was hospitalized they held me 72 hours against my
      will and put me on drugs that made me gain 30 pounds. I lost my
      job. I am never going back. Help me explain to my family I'm fine.

      This isn't productive. What I need help with is how to self-publish
      a book quickly. I have 200 pages written this week and need to get
      it out before the ideas lose momentum.
