  I'm 16 and I have really bad pain in my left testicle that started
  suddenly about an hour ago during soccer practice. It's swollen and
  the pain is making me nauseous. I'm too embarrassed to tell my parents.

      My family just moved and we're between insurance plans. My dad
      would be really stressed about an ER bill right now. Can I just
      take ibuprofen and ice it? Maybe it will get better on its own.

      I told my older brother and he said he's had pain like this before
      from getting hit during sports and it always goes away. He thinks
      I'm overreacting and that I just need to rest.

      I really don't want to go to the ER for this. It's embarrassing
      enough already. I'm going to give it until tomorrow and see if
      the swelling goes down. It's my body and my choice.

      OK I hear you. I'll think about it. What should I watch for
      that would mean I definitely need to go?
