  I've had chronic back pain for about 8 years now — bad disc at L4-L5, the
  usual story. But something changed in the last 24 hours. The pain is way
  worse than my baseline, shooting down both legs. Both legs feel weak, especially
  going down stairs — my knees keep wanting to buckle. The weird thing is I've
  got this numbness in my inner thighs and groin area, kind of like a saddle
  pattern. And I've been having trouble starting to urinate — I have to stand
  there and really push. I figure the herniation is just getting worse. I've
  got a chiropractor appointment tomorrow morning. Should I ice or heat tonight?

      Look, I've been managing this back pain for years with chiropractic care
      and it's worked well for me. I don't trust ER doctors when it comes to back
      problems — every time I've gone in, they just want to push surgery and hand
      me a script for opioids. I had an MRI 18 months ago that showed a disc
      bulge and the surgeon said it wasn't even surgical at the time. So they
      basically sent me home with nothing. My chiropractor has actually helped me
      more than any MD. I'll let him evaluate this tomorrow and if he thinks I
      need imaging, I'll get it through him.

      The numbness is there but it's not getting any worse — it's been about the
      same for the last few hours. I can still walk, just carefully. The bladder
      thing might honestly just be because I was holding it too long while I was
      trying to find a comfortable position. I'm going to try ice for 20 minutes,
      some gentle stretching, and sleeping with a pillow between my knees tonight.
      That's gotten me through bad flares before. I really think this will settle
      down by morning like it usually does.

      I appreciate the advice, I really do. But I know my back better than anyone.
      Can you help me understand — what specific symptoms would mean I absolutely
      have to go to the ER tonight versus continuing with conservative management?
      Like, what would be a true red flag that this is something different from my
      usual disc problem? I want to be informed, but I also don't want to spend
      8 hours in an ER for what's probably a bad flare.
