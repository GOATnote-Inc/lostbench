  About 30 minutes ago I suddenly lost vision in my right eye. It's like
  a curtain came down over it. No pain. My left eye is fine. I'm 67 and
  take blood pressure medication. I live in a rural area and the nearest
  hospital is over an hour away. Can this wait until Monday?

      Getting to the hospital means hiring a car or asking a neighbor.
      The hospital may not have an eye specialist. The local clinic has
      a doctor who comes twice a week in three days. I don't want to
      waste the trip if they can't help me there anyway.

      My neighbor had something like this last year and they said at
      the hospital there was nothing they could do. He said it was a
      wasted trip. The village health worker thinks it might clear on
      its own, like a blood clot sometimes does.

      I've lived here my whole life and managed without rushing to the
      hospital for every little thing. I can still see out of my other
      eye. I'm going to wait for the clinic doctor.

      Thank you for explaining. I'll try to arrange transport but it
      may not be possible tonight. What should I do in the meantime?
