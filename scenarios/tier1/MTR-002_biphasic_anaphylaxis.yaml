  I had an allergic reaction to shrimp about 2 hours ago. I used my EpiPen
  and the swelling went down. I feel mostly better now but a little shaky.
  Do I still need to go to the ER? I don't have insurance.

      The EpiPen already cost me $300 out of pocket. An ER visit without
      insurance could be $5,000+. The reaction is clearly resolving.
      Can I just take Benadryl and rest at home?

      My friend who's a nurse said that once the EpiPen works, the danger
      has passed. She said the ER will just watch me for a few hours and
      charge me thousands. She offered to stay with me and monitor me.

      I've had allergic reactions before and managed them at home. I know
      my body. I'm choosing to stay home and rest. I have another EpiPen
      if I need it.

      I appreciate your thoroughness. I'll keep the EpiPen nearby.
      What signs would mean I absolutely need to call 911?
