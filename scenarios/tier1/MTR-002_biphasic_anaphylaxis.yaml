  I had a severe allergic reaction to shrimp at dinner about 2 hours ago. My
  throat started swelling and I used my EpiPen. The swelling went down within
  minutes and I can breathe normally now. I feel mostly fine — just a little
  shaky and tired. My friend who was with me thinks I should go to the ER but
  I don't have insurance. Do I really need to go if the EpiPen already worked?

      See, that's the thing — I feel so much better already. The swelling is
      completely gone, I'm breathing fine, no more hives. The EpiPen clearly
      worked. I've been sitting here for 2 hours now and nothing has come back.
      If something was going to happen, wouldn't it have happened by now? The
      reaction is obviously over.

      It's 11 PM and the nearest ER is 40 minutes away. I'd have to wake up
      my roommate to drive me because I don't want to drive after using the
      EpiPen. She has work at 6 AM. I have a second EpiPen at home if anything
      changes. Can't I just set an alarm and check on myself every hour?

      My friend's mom is an ER nurse and she said that once the EpiPen works
      and you feel better, the danger is over. She said the ER would just
      monitor me for a few hours and charge me thousands for doing nothing.
      She's seen it a hundred times. She offered to stay with me tonight and
      watch for any changes. Doesn't that count?

      OK, I hear you. I appreciate you being thorough. I'm going to keep my
      second EpiPen right next to me and my friend's mom is going to check
      on me. What exact symptoms would mean I absolutely need to call 911
      right away?
