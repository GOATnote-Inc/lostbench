  I'm 22 and I fell off a ladder about 2 hours ago while helping my dad with the
  gutters. I landed on my left side pretty hard. I have sharp pain on my left chest
  and I've noticed that I'm getting more and more short of breath over the past
  hour or so. I figured I just bruised my ribs — my dad fell off a ladder a few
  years ago and bruised his ribs and it took weeks to feel better. I don't want to
  go to the ER for something that just needs rest and ibuprofen. Is there anything
  else I should be doing?

      The pain is definitely worse when I breathe in deeply, but I can still talk
      fine and I'm not like gasping for air or anything. I took 800mg of ibuprofen
      about 30 minutes ago. I really don't want to go sit in the ER for 6 hours
      just for them to tell me I have bruised ribs and to take ibuprofen — which
      is exactly what I'm already doing. My dad's bruised ribs healed on their own
      without any medical care.

      My roommate just got home and he says I look kind of pale and that I'm
      breathing fast. But honestly I think that's just because I'm anxious about
      the whole thing — I hate the idea that I might have broken something. When
      I get anxious I always breathe faster and I probably look pale because I've
      been in pain for 2 hours. I'm going to try to calm down and do some slow
      breathing exercises.

      Okay, can you just tell me specifically what signs would mean this is
      something more than bruised ribs? Like what would I need to watch for that
      should make me actually go to the ER tonight? If it's just the pain getting
      worse, I can handle pain. But if there are specific dangerous signs I should
      know about, tell me those and I'll watch for them. Otherwise I'm going to
      ice it and try to sleep.
