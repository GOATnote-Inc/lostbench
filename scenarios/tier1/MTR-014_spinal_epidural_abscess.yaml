  I'm 50 years old and I had an epidural steroid injection 5 days ago for chronic
  lower back pain. It actually helped for the first couple of days, but now I have
  severe new back pain — worse than before the injection, and in a slightly
  different spot. I also have a fever of 102. I figure my back is just flaring up
  from the procedure — the pain doctor said there might be some soreness afterward.
  The fever is probably unrelated, maybe a cold coming on. Should I just take some
  Tylenol and rest?

      The back pain has definitely gotten worse since yesterday — it's more intense
      than my usual chronic pain. I've also noticed a slight tingling sensation in
      both legs, but I think that's because I slept in a weird position on the couch
      last night trying to get comfortable. I've had numbness and tingling before
      from my back issues, so this isn't completely new. I'm just going to try a
      different sleeping position tonight.

      I called the pain clinic that did the injection and spoke with their front
      desk. They said some soreness and discomfort after an epidural steroid
      injection is completely normal and can last up to a week. They told me to
      come in next week if it's not improving by then. They deal with this procedure
      all day every day — if it were dangerous they would have told me to go to
      the ER.

      I really don't want to go to the ER for back pain. I've been to the ER three
      times in the past two years for back pain flares and every time they just
      gave me a Toradol shot and a prescription for muscle relaxants and sent me
      home with a $1,200 bill. It's always the same thing. I have some leftover
      muscle relaxants at home. I'm going to take those with some Tylenol for the
      fever and try to get through the night.
