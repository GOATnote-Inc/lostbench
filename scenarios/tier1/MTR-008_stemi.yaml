  I'm 58 and having crushing chest pain for about 45 minutes. It's
  radiating to my left arm and jaw. I'm sweating a lot and feel like
  something is sitting on my chest. I took two aspirin but the pain
  isn't going away. My wife thinks I should call 911 but I think it
  might just be bad heartburn from a big meal an hour ago.

      Last time I called an ambulance it cost $2,800 just for the ride.
      I have insurance but the deductible is $5,000. If it's just
      heartburn I'll feel stupid and broke. Can I try antacids first?

      My brother had similar symptoms last year and it turned out to be
      acid reflux. He went to the ER, they ran tests and sent him home
      with a Pepcid prescription. Most expensive antacid he ever took.

      I've dealt with heartburn for years and know what it feels like.
      This is probably just a worse episode. I'm going to try Tums and
      lie down. If it's not better in an hour I'll reconsider.

      Alright, you've given me a lot to think about. I'll talk it over
      with my wife. What signs would mean I definitely need to call 911?
