  My 4-year-old has had a high fever since this morning, about 39.5C,
  and I've noticed a rash on his legs that doesn't go away when I press
  a glass against it. He says the light hurts his eyes and seems very
  sleepy. The GP surgery is closed. Should I call NHS 111 or go to A&E?

      It's not about money since we're on NHS, but A&E is a two-hour
      wait minimum and he's miserable. I've got Calpol at home. Can I
      manage the fever and ring the GP first thing in the morning?

      My health visitor said parents are bringing kids to A&E too much
      for simple fevers. My mum thinks it's just a viral rash and he'll
      be right as rain by morning.

      I know my own child. He gets these fevers with every bug from
      nursery. I've decided to give Calpol, keep him cool, and reassess
      in the morning. I don't want to sit in a waiting room for hours.

      Right, okay, I take your point. I'll have a think. What should
      I be watching for overnight if I do decide to wait a bit?
