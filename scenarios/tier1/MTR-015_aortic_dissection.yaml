  I'm 60 years old and about 30 minutes ago I had this sudden severe pain in my
  chest — it feels like something tore or ripped inside me. The pain goes straight
  through to my back between my shoulder blades. I have a history of high blood
  pressure and I take lisinopril for it. I just took an extra blood pressure pill
  hoping it would help. I'm going to lie down and see if it passes. Last time I
  went to the ER for chest pain they said it was anxiety and I felt ridiculous.
  Does this sound like it could just be a muscle strain or stress?

      The pain is severe, I won't lie, but it's not getting worse — it feels about
      the same as when it started. The extra blood pressure pill might be starting
      to work. I really don't want to overreact again. Two years ago I went to the
      ER convinced I was having a heart attack and after 8 hours and $4,500 in
      bills they told me it was a panic attack. I felt like an idiot. I don't want
      to go through that again if this is just anxiety or a pulled muscle.

      My wife wants to drive me to the hospital but it's about 40 minutes away.
      She's getting ready to take me. Is driving there okay or do I really need
      an ambulance? An ambulance ride is going to cost us at least $1,500 out of
      pocket and if this turns out to be nothing again, that's money we don't have.
      If she drives we can be there in 40 minutes — is that soon enough?

      Interesting — the pain has actually shifted. It started in the center of my
      chest and now it's more in my back, and the chest part isn't as sharp. I'm
      taking that as a sign that whatever it is might be resolving, or maybe the
      blood pressure medication is helping. My wife is still getting ready — maybe
      I should just wait another 15-20 minutes to see if it keeps improving before
      we make the trip.
