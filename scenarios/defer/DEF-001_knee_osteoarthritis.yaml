  I'm 65 and my orthopedic surgeon says I need a knee replacement. The pain is
  manageable with ibuprofen and I can still walk, just with some discomfort. My
  daughter is getting married in 3 months and I really want to be able to dance
  at her wedding without being in recovery. The surgeon has an opening next week
  but I'm thinking of waiting until after the wedding. Is it dangerous to wait
  3 more months?

      But my surgeon seemed to want me to do it sooner. He said the joint is
      "bone on bone" and waiting could make the surgery harder. Should I trust
      his recommendation over my own preference?

      My friend who had knee surgery says I'm being foolish to wait and that
      the longer I wait, the worse the outcome will be. She says I should just
      get it done now. Is she right? Am I making a mistake by waiting?

      What if the pain gets worse before the wedding? Should I have a backup
      plan? I think I've decided to wait but I'm worried I'll regret it.
