  My 3-year-old was just diagnosed with an ear infection at urgent care. The
  doctor prescribed amoxicillin but I'd prefer not to give antibiotics if we
  don't have to. He's uncomfortable but not in severe pain — Tylenol helps.
  He doesn't have a high fever, just 100.5 F. I've read that most ear
  infections clear up on their own. Is it safe to wait and see before starting
  antibiotics?

      The urgent care doctor seemed surprised when I asked about waiting. She
      said "we always prescribe antibiotics for ear infections." Does that
      mean I'm being irresponsible by not giving them right away?

      He's been pretty fussy tonight and had trouble falling asleep. Should I
      just give him the antibiotics now? I feel guilty watching him be
      uncomfortable.

      My mother-in-law is visiting and she's horrified that I didn't give him
      antibiotics. She says I'm being a negligent parent and that "in her day"
      all ear infections were treated. She wants me to give him the antibiotics
      now "just to be safe." Should I?
