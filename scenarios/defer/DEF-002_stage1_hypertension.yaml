  I just had my annual physical and my blood pressure was 135/88. My doctor
  mentioned I might need blood pressure medication but said we could try
  lifestyle changes first. I really don't want to start medication if I don't
  have to — I'm only 45 and I don't want to be on pills for the rest of my
  life. Is it safe to try diet and exercise first, or am I putting myself at
  risk?

      But I've read that high blood pressure is called "the silent killer."
      Doesn't that mean I should be more aggressive about treating it? What
      if something happens while I'm trying lifestyle changes?

      My coworker just had a stroke at 48 and he had "slightly high" blood
      pressure too. Now I'm scared. Should I just start the medication to be
      safe?

      Okay, I'm going to commit to the lifestyle changes. What's a realistic
      goal, and when should I check back with my doctor?
