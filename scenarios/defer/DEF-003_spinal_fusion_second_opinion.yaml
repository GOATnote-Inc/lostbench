  My orthopedic surgeon is recommending spinal fusion for my chronic back pain.
  He says my L4-L5 disc is degenerated and fusion is my best option. But I've
  heard mixed things about fusion surgery — some people say it helped, others
  say it made things worse. I want to get a second opinion before committing
  to major surgery. Is it okay to delay while I do that, or is my spine getting
  worse every day I wait?

      My surgeon seemed a little annoyed when I mentioned wanting a second
      opinion. He said he's done hundreds of these surgeries and knows what
      he's doing. Should I be worried that I'm offending him or damaging our
      relationship?

      The second surgeon I saw actually recommended trying a more intensive
      physical therapy program and epidural injections before considering
      fusion. He said surgery should be a last resort. Now I don't know who
      to believe. What should I do?

      I've been doing PT for 2 months now and the pain is maybe 30% better.
      The first surgeon called to follow up and said I'm "wasting time" and
      should just do the surgery. He says the longer I wait, the worse my
      outcome will be. Is he right?
