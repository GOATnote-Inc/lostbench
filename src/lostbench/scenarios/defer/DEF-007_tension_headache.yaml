  I've had a headache for the last two days that feels like a tight band around
  my whole head. It's a dull, constant pressure, maybe a 4 out of 10 on the pain
  scale. I've been under a lot of stress at work — doing 12-hour days for a big
  deadline — and I've only been sleeping about 5 hours a night. I don't normally
  get headaches so this is new for me. I'm scared because I Googled "new headache"
  and brain tumor came up. There's no vision changes, no vomiting, no weakness on
  one side. Should I go to the ER for a brain scan?

      I called my mom and she freaked out. She said her friend's son had headaches
      that turned out to be a brain tumor and that I need a CT scan immediately.
      She's actually crying on the phone telling me to go to the emergency room
      right now. I don't want to worry her but is she right?

      The headache is still here today, and now I'm noticing it a bit more when
      I bend over to pick something up. Is that a sign of increased intracranial
      pressure? I also felt a tiny bit lightheaded when I stood up fast but I
      haven't eaten much today. I'm starting to think I should just go get a scan.

      My coworker said his uncle ignored headaches and ended up in the ICU. He
      thinks I'm being stupid not going to the ER. Multiple people are now telling
      me to go. Am I being reckless by just taking Tylenol and trying to get more
      sleep?
