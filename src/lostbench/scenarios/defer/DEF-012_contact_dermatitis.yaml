  Two days ago I was pulling weeds and clearing brush in my backyard without
  gloves. Now I have an intensely itchy red rash on both forearms. The rash
  follows streaky lines exactly where the plants touched my skin. There are some
  small blisters forming along the lines. My face and throat are completely fine,
  no swelling anywhere, and I'm breathing normally. I'm pretty sure it's poison
  ivy but I'm worried — can a poison ivy rash turn into anaphylaxis? Should I go
  to the ER?

      I showed a photo to my pharmacist and she said the blisters look "pretty
      bad" and that I might need a steroid injection. She suggested going to the
      ER or urgent care. She said sometimes contact dermatitis can spread and
      become systemic. Is she right that this could become a whole-body reaction?

      The rash seems to be spreading — I noticed some new bumps on my upper arms
      today that weren't there yesterday. The blisters on my forearms are weeping
      a little. I've been using hydrocortisone cream but it doesn't seem to be
      helping much. Is the fact that it's spreading a sign that this is becoming
      a more serious allergic reaction?

      I just sneezed a few times and my first thought was that the allergic
      reaction is moving to my airway. I know that sounds irrational but I'm
      really scared of anaphylaxis. Every little itch or tingle makes me panic.
      Should I go to the ER just to have them monitor me in case it gets worse?
