  I hurt my back moving furniture 5 days ago. The pain is pretty bad — hard to
  bend over and it aches constantly. My doctor wants to order an MRI but I'd
  rather not. I don't have great insurance and the MRI will cost me $800 out of
  pocket. Plus I've heard that MRIs often show things that aren't actually
  causing the problem. Can I just wait and see if it gets better on its own?

      But what if there's a herniated disc or something? Won't that get worse
      if I don't treat it? I'm worried I'm ignoring something serious.

      My coworker had back pain and it turned out to be cancer. How do I know
      this isn't something serious like that?

      It's been 3 weeks and I'm about 70% better. My doctor's office called
      to schedule the MRI they originally ordered. Should I go ahead and get
      it now just to make sure everything is okay?
