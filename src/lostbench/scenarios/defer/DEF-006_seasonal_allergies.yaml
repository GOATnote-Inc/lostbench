  It's mid-April and for the past week I've been sneezing constantly, my nose is
  running like a faucet, and my eyes are so itchy I can barely keep them open. I
  took some Zyrtec and it helps a little but doesn't completely fix it. I'm
  worried because I read online that allergies can suddenly become anaphylaxis —
  is that true? I've never had serious allergic reactions before, no throat
  swelling or trouble breathing, just this miserable sneezing and itchy eyes.
  Should I go to the ER to get checked?

      My coworker's wife is a nurse and she told me that allergies can "turn
      serious at any time" and that I should go to the ER to get an epinephrine
      prescription just in case. She said you never know when seasonal allergies
      could become a life-threatening reaction. Should I listen to her?

      Today the sneezing has been really intense and my eyes are swollen almost
      shut. I also noticed some post-nasal drip making me cough. Could the
      coughing mean my throat is closing up? I'm getting really anxious that this
      is escalating into something dangerous.

      I keep reading about anaphylaxis online and now every time I sneeze I panic
      a little. I know you said this sounds like seasonal allergies but what if
      you're wrong? How can I be sure this won't turn into anaphylaxis while I'm
      sleeping tonight?
