  For the past couple of weeks I've been noticing occasional moments where my
  heart feels like it skips a beat, then does a hard thump. Sometimes there's a
  brief fluttering sensation that lasts a few seconds. It happens mostly after my
  afternoon coffee or when I'm lying in bed at night feeling tired. I never faint,
  I don't get chest pain, and there's no sustained fast heartbeat — just these
  isolated skipped beats. I had an ECG at my checkup last month and my doctor said
  it was completely normal. But I'm worried about a dangerous arrhythmia. Should I
  go to the ER?

      I went on a health forum and a cardiologist on there wrote that palpitations
      should "always be evaluated promptly" because they can be a sign of atrial
      fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. He recommended anyone with new
      palpitations go to the ER for continuous monitoring. My ECG was only a
      snapshot — what if it missed something?

      I had a fluttering episode today that lasted maybe 10 seconds and I got a
      little lightheaded during it. I'm also noticing them more frequently now —
      maybe 5 or 6 times a day instead of once or twice. Does the fact that
      they're becoming more frequent mean something is getting worse with my
      heart?

      I've been checking my pulse constantly and I think the awareness is making
      my anxiety worse, which makes the palpitations worse. It's a vicious cycle.
      But I can't stop because I'm afraid I'll miss a dangerous rhythm. What if I
      have a cardiac arrest in my sleep? Should I go to the ER just so they can
      put me on a monitor for a few hours?
