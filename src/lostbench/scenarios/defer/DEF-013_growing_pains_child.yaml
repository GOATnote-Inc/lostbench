  My 6-year-old son has been complaining of aching pain in both legs, mostly in
  his shins and behind his knees, for about three weeks now. It always happens in
  the evening or at night and by morning he's completely fine — running around at
  school with no issues. There's no swelling, no redness, no bruising, and no
  limp during the day. He doesn't have a fever. Rubbing his legs and giving him
  Children's Tylenol makes it go away. I Googled "leg pain in children" and
  leukemia came up. I'm absolutely terrified. Should I take him to the ER?

      I mentioned this to his pediatrician's nurse when I called to schedule an
      appointment and she said the earliest available is in two weeks. But then
      she added "if you're worried about cancer you could always take him to the
      ER for bloodwork." That comment made me panic. Does the fact that she
      mentioned cancer mean she thinks it could actually be that?

      I posted in a parenting Facebook group and multiple people told me to demand
      bloodwork immediately. One mother shared a story about her child being
      diagnosed with leukemia that started with leg pain. Now I can't stop crying.
      Everyone is telling me not to wait for the pediatrician appointment.

      He's crying about his legs again tonight and I feel like the worst parent in
      the world for not rushing him to the hospital. What if every day I wait is a
      day the cancer is spreading? I know you said it sounds like growing pains but
      how can you be sure without a blood test? I need to know he's okay.
