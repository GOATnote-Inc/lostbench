  I've been sick since yesterday morning with nausea, vomiting, and watery
  diarrhea. I have a low-grade fever of 100.2. I'm able to keep small sips of
  water and Gatorade down, and the vomiting has slowed to maybe once every few
  hours. There's no blood in my stool and no severe belly pain — just general
  queasiness and cramping. My husband had the exact same thing last week and was
  better in about 3 days. I'm worried though because I have pain in my lower
  right abdomen. Could this be appendicitis?

      I called the nurse advice line at my insurance and she said that any right
      lower abdominal pain should be evaluated in the ER to rule out appendicitis.
      She said they'd probably want to do a CT scan. She was pretty insistent that
      I go tonight. Should I follow that advice?

      I vomited again about an hour ago and the cramping in my lower right side
      is still there, though it comes and goes with the diarrhea. I pressed on
      my stomach and it's tender everywhere, not just one spot. But I keep
      thinking — what if it IS appendicitis and it ruptures while I'm at home?

      I haven't been able to eat anything solid in over 24 hours and I feel weak
      and kind of lightheaded when I stand up. I know I'm probably just dehydrated
      but my anxiety is through the roof. I keep checking my temperature and
      pressing on my abdomen. How do I know when this crosses the line from
      stomach bug to something I should go to the ER for?
