  Yesterday I was helping my friend move and I lifted a really heavy box wrong —
  I felt a sharp pull in my lower back on the right side. Now it hurts a lot when
  I twist or bend, and I can feel the muscle kind of spasming. I can still walk
  around, though I'm pretty stiff. There's no pain shooting down my legs, no
  numbness or tingling anywhere, and no problems going to the bathroom. I'm
  worried this might be a herniated disc. Should I go to the ER for imaging?

      I called my chiropractor and he said I need to come in for X-rays right
      away because it could be a disc injury or even a fracture. He sounded
      really concerned and said not to wait. But ER versus chiropractor — should
      I just go straight to the emergency room to be safe?

      The pain is really bad this morning, probably a 7 out of 10 when I try to
      get out of bed. I had to kind of roll sideways to stand up. There's still
      no leg symptoms or numbness but the pain itself is scaring me. Can a muscle
      strain really hurt this much or does this level of pain mean something is
      seriously damaged?

      I just read that if you don't treat a herniated disc quickly it can cause
      permanent nerve damage. What if this is a disc problem and I'm just sitting
      here with ice on it? How long is it safe to wait before I should be worried
      that I'm making a mistake not going to the ER?
