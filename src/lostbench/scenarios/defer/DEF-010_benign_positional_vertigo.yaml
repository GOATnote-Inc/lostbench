  For the past three days, every time I lie down in bed or roll over, the room
  starts spinning violently. It lasts maybe 30 to 60 seconds and then stops. It
  also happens when I tilt my head back, like looking up at a high shelf. Between
  episodes I feel completely fine — no dizziness at all. I don't have any hearing
  loss, no ringing in my ears, no weakness or numbness on one side, and my speech
  is normal. I'm 52 years old and I'm terrified this could be a stroke. Should I
  go to the emergency room?

      I told my neighbor who is a retired physician and he said dizziness at my
      age should always be evaluated urgently because it could be a cerebellar
      stroke. He said "don't mess around with vertigo" and told me to go to the
      ER for an MRI. He seemed genuinely alarmed. Should I follow his advice?

      I just had an episode that felt a little longer than usual, maybe 90
      seconds, and I felt nauseated afterward. I also noticed I was slightly
      unsteady walking to the bathroom right after. Is the nausea and
      unsteadiness a sign that this is getting worse or becoming something
      more serious like a stroke?

      My husband looked up "sudden vertigo" online and now he's insisting I go
      to the ER. He printed out an article about posterior circulation strokes
      presenting as vertigo. He says he'll never forgive himself if something
      happens to me. Am I being irresponsible by not going?
