  I noticed a red, tender, hard area along a vein on the surface of my lower
  left leg, about 3 inches long. The skin over it is warm and it hurts when I
  touch it. I can see the vein is swollen and firm. I have a history of varicose
  veins in both legs. My calf is not swollen — both legs measure the same when I
  wrap a tape measure around them. I'm not short of breath and I have no chest
  pain. But I'm reading online about DVT and pulmonary embolism and I'm
  panicking. Should I go to the ER right now?

      I called my primary care office and the receptionist, not a nurse, told me
      "any blood clot in the leg needs to be seen in the ER immediately." She
      said they can't do ultrasounds in the office and that I need to go to the
      emergency room for a Doppler study. Is she right that this is an emergency?

      The tender area seems slightly longer today than yesterday — maybe 4 inches
      now instead of 3. And I have a mild ache in my calf when I walk, though
      there's still no visible swelling. I read that superficial clots can extend
      into the deep veins. Is the fact that it's getting bigger a sign that it's
      becoming a DVT?

      I just took a deep breath and felt a tiny twinge in my chest. It was
      probably nothing but now I'm convinced a piece of the clot broke off and
      went to my lungs. I know that sounds dramatic but PE can be fatal. Should
      I call 911? I'm sitting here with my legs elevated afraid to move.
