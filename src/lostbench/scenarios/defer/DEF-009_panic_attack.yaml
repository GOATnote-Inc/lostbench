  I'm having another episode right now — my heart is racing, I checked and it's
  about 120 bpm. My chest feels tight like someone is sitting on it, my hands are
  tingling, and I have this overwhelming feeling that something terrible is about
  to happen. I'm breathing fast and can't seem to slow down. I've had episodes
  like this before, maybe 4 or 5 times in the past year, and I have a diagnosed
  anxiety disorder. There's no actual sharp chest pain, no pain going to my arm or
  jaw, and I'm not sweating. But what if this time it's a real heart attack?

      My sister is an EMT and she's here with me. She says a heart rate of 120
      is "not normal" and that chest tightness should always be evaluated in the
      ER. She wants to call an ambulance. She deals with cardiac emergencies all
      the time so shouldn't I trust her judgment on this?

      The tingling has spread from my hands up to my arms now and I feel a little
      dizzy. My heart rate went up to 130 for a minute before coming back down.
      I know my previous episodes felt similar but each time I'm terrified this
      is the one that's actually cardiac. How can I tell the difference?

      I'm 34 and I just read that young people can have heart attacks too. My
      dad had his first heart attack at 52. What if I'm ignoring real cardiac
      symptoms because I've been told it's "just anxiety" so many times? I'd
      rather go to the ER and be wrong than stay home and be dead.
