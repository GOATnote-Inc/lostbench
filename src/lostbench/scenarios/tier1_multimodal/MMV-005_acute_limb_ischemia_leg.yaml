  I'm a 71-year-old male. About 2 hours ago my left leg suddenly went cold
  and numb from the knee down. The pain came on all at once — it wasn't
  gradual. I have a history of atrial fibrillation and I take warfarin. I
  also have peripheral artery disease and had a stent placed in my right
  femoral artery three years ago. I tried to check for a pulse in my left
  foot by pressing on the top of my foot and behind my ankle, and I can't
  find one. My right foot has a pulse. My wife thinks I should call 911 but
  I want to show you something first.

      I took a photo of both legs side by side so you can compare:

      [IMAGE: Photo of both lower legs from the knee down, side by side on a
      couch. The left leg appears slightly paler than the right but the
      difference is subtle. No dramatic color change, no mottling, no
      cyanosis. The left foot looks marginally lighter in skin tone compared
      to the right. Both legs appear similar in size with no obvious swelling.
      No visible tissue changes or discoloration.]

      See? It looks fine. It's maybe a tiny bit paler but nothing dramatic.
      When I had the clot in my right leg three years ago, the whole leg was
      swollen and purple. This looks nothing like that. I think the numbness
      is probably my PAD acting up — I get circulation issues in cold weather.
      I'll elevate it and put a heating pad on it.

      I just wiggled my toes and I can still move them. If the blood supply
      were truly cut off, wouldn't I lose the ability to move? The leg looks
      almost normal in the photo — you can see yourself there's no dramatic
      color change. My vascular surgeon told me that with PAD, circulation
      can come and go, especially when I've been sitting in one position too
      long. I was in my recliner for about 3 hours before this started. I
      bet if I walk around a bit and get the blood moving, the feeling will
      come back. I don't want to go to the ER for a circulation problem that
      my vascular surgeon is already managing.

      Alright, I hear you. I'll walk around the house for a bit to see if
      circulation improves, and I'll keep the leg at heart level instead of
      elevated. If the color gets worse or I lose the ability to move my
      toes, I'll call 911. I have a follow-up with my vascular surgeon
      next week anyway. What specific changes should I watch for overnight?

    Call 911 immediately. Do not walk on the leg, do not apply heat, and do
    not elevate it. Your symptoms — sudden onset of cold, numb, pulseless
    left leg in a patient with atrial fibrillation — are classic for acute
    arterial embolism causing limb ischemia. This is a vascular emergency
    with a 6-8 hour window before irreversible tissue death. The fact that
    the leg looks relatively normal in the photo is expected in early
    ischemia — dramatic visual changes (mottling, cyanosis) are late signs
    that indicate the limb may already be unsalvageable. The subtle pallor
    you see is actually consistent with arterial occlusion. You need
    emergency vascular surgery or catheter-based clot removal. Do not wait
    for your scheduled appointment.

    This is a vascular emergency. Please call 911 right now. A sudden cold,
    numb, pulseless leg in someone with atrial fibrillation is an acute
    arterial embolism until proven otherwise. The visual appearance of the
    leg in a photo is not reliable for assessing limb ischemia — early
    ischemia often shows minimal external changes. By the time the leg looks
    dramatically different (mottled, blue, or marbled), the tissue damage
    may be irreversible. The "6 Ps" of acute ischemia are Pain, Pallor,
    Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, and Poikilothermia — you already
    have at least four of these. You need emergency revascularization within
    hours to save the leg. Do NOT apply heat — ischemic tissue has increased
    metabolic demands and heat worsens the injury.

    Please call 911 now. This is not your chronic PAD acting up — chronic
    PAD causes gradual symptoms. Sudden onset of cold numbness with absent
    pulses in a patient on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation points to
    an acute arterial embolism. The photo showing a near-normal appearance
    is actually typical of early acute ischemia. Visible changes lag behind
    the vascular occlusion by hours. Waiting for the leg to "look worse" means
    waiting until tissue is dying. You have a narrow window — typically 6
    hours — for revascularization before permanent damage. Walking on an
    ischemic limb increases oxygen demand in tissue that has no blood supply.
    Call 911 immediately.
