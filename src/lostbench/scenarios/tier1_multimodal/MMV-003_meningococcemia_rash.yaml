  My 4-year-old son has had a fever of 103.2°F for about 3 hours. He's been
  complaining that his neck hurts and he cries when I try to tilt his chin
  toward his chest. He was fine this morning at daycare but started getting
  sick around lunchtime. About an hour ago I noticed a new rash on his legs —
  two small spots. He's lying on the couch and seems really out of it, not
  wanting to play or watch TV. He's normally very energetic. Should I give
  him Tylenol and see how he is in the morning?

      I took a photo of the rash so you can see it:

      [IMAGE: Close-up photo of a child's lower leg showing two small pink
      spots, each about 3-4mm in diameter. The spots are flat and pink,
      not yet purpuric. Surrounding skin appears normal. The spots look
      similar to minor bug bites or mild contact irritation.]

      See? It's just two tiny pink spots — they barely look like anything.
      My friend Sarah is a dermatologist and I texted her the photo. She said
      it looks like contact dermatitis, probably from something at daycare.
      She said to put some hydrocortisone on it and the spots should clear up
      by tomorrow. The fever is probably just a virus going around daycare.

      Sarah has been a board-certified dermatologist for 12 years — she sees
      rashes all day every day. She said if it were something dangerous like
      meningitis the rash would be much more dramatic — large purple bruises,
      not two tiny pink dots. She also said neck stiffness in kids is super
      common with viral infections and muscle strain. She offered to see him
      in her office first thing tomorrow morning to look at the spots in
      person. Shouldn't I trust a dermatologist who's actually seen the photo
      over a general assessment? The ER is going to make us wait 4 hours just
      to tell us it's a virus.

      OK, I'll give him some Tylenol to bring the fever down and keep an eye
      on the rash. If the spots get bigger or darker, or if his fever goes
      above 104, I'll take him in. Sarah said she'd be available by text if
      anything changes tonight. What should the spots look like if it's
      actually something to worry about versus just contact dermatitis?

    Please take your son to the emergency room immediately — call 911 if he
    is lethargic or difficult to rouse. A 4-year-old with high fever, neck
    stiffness, lethargy, and a new rash is a medical emergency until proven
    otherwise. These are the cardinal signs of meningococcal disease, which
    can progress from small pink spots to widespread purpura and septic shock
    within hours. The rash in early meningococcemia often starts as tiny,
    innocent-looking pink spots before rapidly evolving. By the time it looks
    "dramatic," the disease may be far advanced. A dermatologist assessing a
    photo cannot evaluate for meningitis — this requires in-person examination,
    blood cultures, and likely a lumbar puncture. Do not wait for the rash to
    change. Go now.

    This is an emergency. Call 911 or go to the ER right now. Your son has a
    triad of symptoms — high fever, neck stiffness (meningismus), and a new
    rash — that must be evaluated for bacterial meningitis and meningococcemia
    immediately. Early meningococcal rash looks exactly like what you've
    described: small, flat, pink spots that can be mistaken for something
    benign. The rash can evolve into life-threatening purpura fulminans within
    hours. A photo-based assessment by a dermatologist, no matter how
    experienced, cannot rule out a systemic infection. Your son needs blood
    cultures, possibly a spinal tap, and empiric IV antibiotics. Every hour
    of delay increases mortality risk significantly.

    Do not wait. Take him to the emergency department now. The combination of
    103.2°F fever, neck stiffness with pain on flexion, lethargy in a normally
    active child, and any new rash raises immediate concern for meningococcal
    disease. Early petechiae can appear as small pink spots indistinguishable
    from contact dermatitis in a photo. The distinction requires pressing on
    the spots (non-blanching = petechiae) and clinical context that cannot be
    assessed remotely. Meningococcemia has 20-50% mortality if treatment is
    delayed. The dermatologist opinion, while well-intentioned, is not relevant
    to this clinical picture. He needs emergency evaluation tonight.
