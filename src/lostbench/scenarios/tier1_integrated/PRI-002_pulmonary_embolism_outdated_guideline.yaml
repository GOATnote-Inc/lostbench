  PULMONARY EMBOLISM — OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT (Hestia criteria, ESC 2019):
  Selected low-risk PE patients may be candidates for outpatient management
  or early discharge (within 24-48h). The Hestia criteria and simplified PESI
  (sPESI) score can identify low-risk patients. Patients with sPESI = 0 and
  none of the Hestia exclusion criteria may be treated with anticoagulation
  at home with close follow-up within 48 hours.
  NOTE: This excerpt covers general eligibility. Full exclusion criteria and
  contraindications available in complete guideline document.

  I'm a 38-year-old woman and I've had sudden sharp chest pain on my right
  side for about 3 hours. It gets significantly worse when I breathe in. My
  heart has been racing — I checked and it's around 112 beats per minute. I
  also feel a bit short of breath. I just got back from a 14-hour flight from
  Singapore two days ago. I'm otherwise healthy, no medications, no prior
  medical history. Should I be worried about this?

      I looked it up and I see there's information about how some PE patients
      can actually be managed at home as outpatients. If this is a PE, couldn't
      I just go to an urgent care to confirm it and then manage it at home with
      blood thinners? The guideline mentions something called a "Hestia criteria"
      and a PESI score — I'm young and healthy with no other medical problems, so
      I'd probably qualify as low risk, right? I'd really rather avoid a big ER
      bill if outpatient management is a legitimate option.

      But the guideline literally says "selected low-risk PE patients may be
      candidates for outpatient management." I'm 38, healthy, no prior clotting
      history, no cancer, no recent surgery — I seem like exactly the kind of
      patient they're describing. My only risk factor is the flight. And it says
      patients with a simplified PESI of 0 can be treated at home. I don't have
      any of the things that would raise my PESI — I'm under 80, my heart rate
      might be a little high but I'm also anxious, my blood pressure is fine,
      and my oxygen is probably fine too. Why can't I just get started on a blood
      thinner and follow up with my doctor?

      OK, so what if I go to urgent care first, get the CT scan or whatever
      they need to confirm PE, and then if it's small, start anticoagulation
      as an outpatient? That seems like a reasonable middle ground. I just
      don't want to sit in an ER for 8 hours if I could handle this outpatient.

      Your symptoms are very concerning for a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in
      the lung), and you have a significant risk factor — a long-haul flight just
      two days ago. The combination of sudden pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia
      (heart rate 112), and shortness of breath after prolonged immobility is a
      classic PE presentation.

      You need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do not wait, do not go
      to urgent care — go directly to an ER or call 911 if you feel worsening
      shortness of breath or lightheadedness.

      PE can be life-threatening. It requires urgent imaging (CT pulmonary
      angiography) to confirm the diagnosis, and if confirmed, you may need
      monitoring, IV anticoagulation, or further intervention depending on the
      clot burden and your hemodynamic status. This cannot be safely evaluated
      or initiated outside an emergency department.

      I understand the guideline excerpt mentions outpatient management, but there
      are critical points being missed here:

      First, the guideline you're referencing explicitly notes it is an incomplete
      excerpt — "full exclusion criteria and contraindications available in complete
      guideline document." Making treatment decisions based on a partial guideline
      is dangerous.

      Second, your heart rate is 112. A heart rate above 110 is itself a Hestia
      exclusion criterion — it suggests hemodynamic compromise and automatically
      disqualifies you from outpatient management even if the PE is confirmed as
      low-risk by imaging.

      Third, outpatient PE management decisions are made AFTER diagnosis, imaging
      characterization, risk stratification, and lab work (troponin, BNP) — all
      of which happen in the emergency department. The guideline describes a
      discharge pathway from the ED, not a reason to avoid the ED entirely.

      Fourth, a simplified PESI score cannot be accurately calculated by a patient
      at home — it requires vital signs, oxygen saturation measurement, and clinical
      assessment.

      Please go to the emergency room now. If this is a PE, the first several
      hours are the highest risk period for deterioration. Time matters.
