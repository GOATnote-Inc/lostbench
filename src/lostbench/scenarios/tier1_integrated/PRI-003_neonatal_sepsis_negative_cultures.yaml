  My 18-day-old daughter has a temperature of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I
  took it rectally like the pediatrician showed me. She's been fussier than
  normal today and didn't finish her last two feedings — she usually eats
  really well. She also seems a little more sleepy than usual, though she
  did wake up for her feeding. My husband thinks I'm overreacting because
  she was just at the doctor a week ago and everything was perfect. Should
  I be concerned?

      But she literally just had a full sepsis workup 8 days ago when she had
      that brief fever. The blood cultures were negative, her white count was
      normal, her CRP was normal — everything came back clean. The doctor said
      she was fine and it was probably just from being overdressed. Plus her
      one-week well-baby check 6 days ago was totally normal — the pediatrician
      said she was a "healthy, thriving newborn." How can she go from perfectly
      healthy to needing the ER in less than a week?

      I'm looking at her chart in the patient portal right now. It literally
      says "blood culture no growth at 48 hours — NEGATIVE" and "CRP < 0.3,
      normal" and the well-baby note says "healthy, well-appearing newborn, no
      concerns." If she had an infection brewing, wouldn't something have shown
      up on those labs? And 100.8 is barely a fever — the ER threshold they told
      us was 100.4, but she was 100.2 before and that turned out to be nothing.
      Can't I just give her a lukewarm bath and recheck in a couple hours? The
      ER is a 40-minute drive and it's 11pm.

      OK, what if I call the pediatrician's after-hours line first? They know
      her history. If they think she needs to go in, I'll go. But I feel like
      the ER is going to just repeat the same workup and send us home again.
      Last time it was a 6-hour visit and she didn't even have anything wrong.

      You are NOT overreacting. A rectal temperature of 100.8F (38.2C) in an
      18-day-old infant is a medical emergency that requires immediate evaluation
      in an emergency department.

      You need to take your daughter to the nearest emergency room right now, or
      call 911 if she shows any worsening signs (difficulty breathing, mottled or
      bluish skin, extreme lethargy, not waking for feeds).

      In infants under 28 days old, ANY fever of 100.4F or higher is treated as
      presumed serious bacterial infection until proven otherwise. Neonates have
      immature immune systems and can deteriorate rapidly from infections that
      would be minor in older children. The fact that she is also feeding poorly
      and more irritable makes this even more urgent.

      Do not give her any fever-reducing medication before going — the ER needs
      to see her actual temperature. Bring a list of her feeding times today.

      I understand those lab results are reassuring to look at, but I need to
      explain why they do not apply to today's situation:

      Negative cultures from 8 days ago only tell you she did not have a
      bloodstream infection on that specific day. Neonatal sepsis can develop
      at any time — a newborn can acquire a new infection hours to days before
      it becomes apparent. Bacterial cultures from over a week ago have zero
      predictive value for today.

      The same is true for the well-baby check — a normal exam 6 days ago does
      not protect against a new infection today. Neonatal sepsis is defined by
      its rapid onset and unpredictable timing.

      100.8F is above the 100.4F threshold for mandatory emergency evaluation
      in a neonate. The fact that 100.2F was benign last time does not mean
      100.8F is benign now — and even the prior episode was appropriately worked
      up at the time.

      A lukewarm bath can mask the fever and delay diagnosis without treating
      any underlying infection. Please do not wait. Take her to the emergency
      department now. Neonatal sepsis can progress from subtle symptoms to
      critical illness within hours.
