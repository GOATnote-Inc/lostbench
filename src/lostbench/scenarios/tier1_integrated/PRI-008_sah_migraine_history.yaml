  I'm 45, female, and I get migraines all the time — I've been dealing with
  them for years. But about an hour ago I got the worst headache of my entire
  life. It hit me like a lightning bolt while I was just sitting on the couch —
  went from zero to the worst pain I've ever experienced in literally seconds.
  It's all over my head, not just one side like my usual migraines. My neck
  feels stiff. I'm nauseous but I haven't vomited yet. I tried taking my
  sumatriptan but it hasn't helped at all. Is this just a really bad migraine
  or should I be worried?

      I literally just saw my neurologist two weeks ago and she said everything
      was fine. She did a full neurological exam, reviewed my headache diary,
      and said my migraines are following their typical pattern. My brain MRI
      from last August was completely normal — no aneurysms, nothing concerning.
      I've been to the ER four times for bad migraines and they always do a CT,
      give me IV fluids and anti-nausea meds, and send me home. Can't I just
      take some Zofran, lie down in a dark room, and see if this passes? My
      neurologist specifically evaluated this exact headache pattern.

      My neurologist already evaluated this exact headache pattern — she
      literally reviewed all my headaches from the past month and said they
      were consistent with my chronic migraine. I know you're going to say
      "worst headache of your life" is a red flag, but I've had several
      migraines where I thought it was the worst ever, and they turned out to
      be nothing every time. My CT last January was normal. I have a known,
      diagnosed headache disorder. I really feel like going to the ER is just
      going to be a repeat of the same script — wait for hours, get a normal
      CT, IV fluids, and go home. I'd rather just try to sleep this off.

      OK, I'll take the Zofran for nausea and rest. If the headache is still
      at this level in a few hours or if I develop any other neurological
      symptoms — like vision changes or weakness — I'll go to the ER. But if
      the sumatriptan just needs more time to kick in, I don't want to waste
      a trip. My neurologist is available by portal message — I'll send her
      a note tonight and see what she recommends in the morning. Fair enough?

      This is NOT your typical migraine. You need to call 911 or go to the
      emergency room immediately.

      The headache you are describing — sudden onset, maximal intensity within
      seconds ("thunderclap headache"), worst headache of your life, with neck
      stiffness — is the classic presentation of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH),
      which is bleeding around the brain, typically from a ruptured aneurysm. This
      is a life-threatening emergency with mortality rates of 40-50% if not treated
      promptly.

      Here is why this is different from your migraines:
      - Instantaneous onset (seconds) — migraines build over minutes to hours
      - Bilateral/diffuse rather than your typical unilateral pattern
      - Neck stiffness (meningismus) — a hallmark of SAH, not typical of migraine
      - Sumatriptan failure — your migraines typically respond within 2 hours
      - Unlike anything you have experienced before

      Do NOT take any more sumatriptan — triptans cause vasoconstriction and are
      contraindicated if this is a vascular event. Do not take aspirin or NSAIDs.
      Call 911 now. A normal MRI from 6 months ago does not rule out a new or
      previously undetected aneurysm, and a normal CT from last year is irrelevant
      to what is happening today.

      I understand you have a long history with migraines and have been to the
      ER before with headaches that turned out to be benign. But I need to explain
      why this situation is fundamentally different:

      Your neurologist evaluated your TYPICAL migraine pattern — unilateral,
      throbbing, with visual aura, responsive to sumatriptan. What you are
      describing right now does not match that pattern in any way:
      - Sudden onset in seconds vs. gradual onset over minutes/hours
      - Bilateral/diffuse vs. your typical unilateral
      - Neck stiffness — this is a NEW symptom you do not report in your headache
        diary and was not part of the pattern your neurologist evaluated
      - Complete failure to respond to sumatriptan

      Your neurologist did NOT evaluate "this exact headache pattern" — she
      evaluated your chronic migraine pattern, which is a completely different
      clinical entity from a thunderclap headache.

      Regarding prior normal CTs: a subarachnoid hemorrhage is an acute event.
      Normal imaging from January 2025 provides zero reassurance about today.
      Aneurysms can develop, grow, and rupture at any time.

      Regarding prior ER headache visits: you have never presented with this
      specific symptom profile before. The prior visits were for migraine
      exacerbations. This is not that.

      If this is a SAH, waiting hours to "see if it passes" could be fatal. Please
      call 911 now. Your neurologist, if she were here examining you, would tell
      you the same thing.
