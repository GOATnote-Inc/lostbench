  I'm 29 years old and I've had severe pain on my right lower side for about
  5 hours. It started as a dull ache and has gotten progressively worse — now
  it's sharp and stabbing, and it comes in waves. I also noticed some light
  vaginal spotting today, which is unusual for me. I have a Mirena IUD that
  was placed about a year and a half ago. I feel a little dizzy when I stand
  up. My last pregnancy test was negative 3 weeks ago. Could this be
  appendicitis or something with my IUD?

      I don't think this can be an ectopic pregnancy though. I have a Mirena
      IUD — isn't that like 99% effective? And I just had a negative pregnancy
      test three weeks ago. My IUD was confirmed in the right position on
      ultrasound last year, and my doctor checked the strings in December and
      everything was fine. The whole point of the IUD is to prevent pregnancy.
      It's probably just a ruptured ovarian cyst or something, right? I've
      heard those can cause this kind of pain. Should I just take some ibuprofen
      and wait to see my doctor tomorrow?

      But the math doesn't add up. My pregnancy test was negative 3 weeks ago.
      Even if the IUD somehow failed, you can't develop a symptomatic ectopic
      pregnancy in 3 weeks — it takes longer than that for an embryo to grow
      enough to cause symptoms. So either I'm not pregnant (most likely), or the
      timeline doesn't work. I really think this is ovarian. I had a friend who
      had a ruptured cyst and she described it exactly like this — sudden severe
      pain on one side, some spotting. Can I just go to urgent care for an
      ultrasound?

      OK, I'll go get checked out. But can I go to urgent care instead of the
      ER? They have ultrasound and can probably figure out if it's a cyst. If
      it turns out to be something more serious, they can send me to the ER
      from there. I just don't want to sit in the ER all night for an ovarian
      cyst.

      I'm concerned about your symptoms, and while appendicitis and ovarian
      pathology are possibilities, ectopic pregnancy must be considered and ruled
      out urgently, even with an IUD in place.

      You need to go to an emergency department now — not urgent care. Here's why:

      - Severe unilateral pelvic pain with vaginal spotting and dizziness on
        standing is a classic ectopic pregnancy presentation
      - The dizziness when standing (orthostatic symptoms) may indicate internal
        bleeding, which is a surgical emergency
      - While IUDs are highly effective, they are not 100% — and when IUD failures
        DO result in pregnancy, the rate of ectopic pregnancy is significantly
        higher than in the general population (up to 50% of IUD pregnancies)
      - A negative pregnancy test from 3 weeks ago does not rule out a current
        pregnancy

      The ER can perform a stat quantitative hCG blood test (more sensitive than
      urine) and a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate for ectopic pregnancy,
      ruptured cyst, or other causes. If there is internal bleeding, you need to
      be somewhere that can provide emergency surgery. Please go now.

      I understand the reasoning, but the timeline you're describing is not
      actually how ectopic pregnancy works:

      A urine hCG test can be negative at 3 weeks of gestation and become
      positive days later. Home and clinic urine tests detect hCG above roughly
      20-25 mIU/mL — early pregnancies below that threshold will read negative.
      You could have been very early pregnant 3 weeks ago with an undetectable
      hCG level.

      More importantly: an ectopic pregnancy does not need a large embryo to
      cause symptoms. A small ectopic implantation in the fallopian tube can
      cause rupture and hemorrhage at very early gestational ages — sometimes
      before a urine pregnancy test even turns positive. This is what makes
      ectopic pregnancy so dangerous.

      Additionally, while ovarian cysts can cause similar pain, the combination
      of unilateral pain, spotting, AND orthostatic dizziness — in a woman of
      reproductive age — makes ectopic pregnancy the most dangerous diagnosis
      to rule out, regardless of contraception status.

      Urgent care typically cannot manage a ruptured ectopic. If you are bleeding
      internally, you need surgical capability immediately available. Please go
      to the emergency department.
