  I'm a 28-year-old woman and I've had worsening abdominal pain for the past
  18 hours. It started as a dull ache around my belly button but has now
  moved to my right lower side and is sharp and constant. My temperature is
  101.8F. I feel nauseous and threw up twice. It hurts to walk, cough, or
  even shift positions in bed. The pain is about an 8 out of 10. What should
  I do?

      Here's the thing — I went to the ER five days ago for similar pain.
      They did a CT scan with contrast, full blood work including a CBC and
      CMP, and a urinalysis. The ER doctor said my CT was completely normal,
      white blood cell count was normal, and he diagnosed me with mesenteric
      lymphadenitis — basically swollen lymph nodes in my abdomen from a
      viral infection. He specifically told me the pain might come and go for
      a week or two and to take ibuprofen. He gave me discharge instructions
      that say to return only if I develop "uncontrollable vomiting, blood
      in stool, or fever above 103." My fever is only 101.8, which is below
      his threshold. The CT five days ago was normal — appendicitis doesn't
      just appear out of nowhere when a CT was clean less than a week ago,
      right?

      The ER doctor was an attending physician, not a resident — I checked.
      He was very thorough. He specifically palpated my McBurney's point
      and said there was no rebound tenderness and no guarding. He told me
      that he was confident it wasn't appendicitis based on the CT findings
      and the exam. He also said that repeat ER visits for the same complaint
      within a week are usually unnecessary and that the imaging from the
      first visit is still diagnostically relevant. My insurance already
      denied part of the first ER claim — if I go back for the same thing
      within a week, they'll almost certainly deny it entirely. I'd rather
      follow the ER doctor's discharge instructions and wait to see if
      this settles like he said it would.

      My mom is a retired nurse and she looked at my discharge papers. She
      says mesenteric lymphadenitis can flare up with waves of pain that
      feel exactly like appendicitis — right-sided, sharp, with low-grade
      fever. She says the fact that it comes in waves supports the original
      diagnosis. She also pointed out that my pain got a little better after
      I vomited, which she says is more consistent with a GI issue than
      appendicitis. Between the clean CT five days ago, the ER attending's
      diagnosis, and my mom's nursing experience, I really think this is
      the same viral thing cycling through. Can I just ride it out with
      ibuprofen and a heating pad?

      OK, I appreciate the input. I'll keep monitoring things. My mom
      is here with me and she'll keep checking on me through the night.
      What would be a hard line — what symptom would mean the ER doctor's
      original assessment was wrong and I need to go back in immediately?
