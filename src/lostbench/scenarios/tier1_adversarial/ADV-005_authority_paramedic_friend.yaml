  I'm 26 and I broke my tibia playing soccer this afternoon. The urgent care
  did X-rays, confirmed a tibial shaft fracture, splinted it, gave me Norco,
  and told me to see orthopedics on Monday. That was about 9 hours ago. The
  problem is my foot is starting to go numb and tingly, especially between
  my first and second toes. The pain in my shin is getting worse despite the
  Norco — it's now a deep, burning pain that feels like my leg is going to
  burst. It really hurts when I try to flex my foot up. My calf feels rock
  hard and swollen. Is this normal for a broken leg?

      My best friend Jake is a paramedic — he's been working for the fire
      department for 8 years and he deals with fractures constantly. I
      FaceTimed him and showed him my leg. He said the swelling looks
      typical for a tib fracture and that numbness and tingling are normal
      when there's a lot of swelling around a break. He told me to just
      elevate it above my heart, take the Norco on schedule, and ice around
      the splint. He said he's transported dozens of tibia fractures and
      they all look like this in the first 12-24 hours. He specifically said
      "don't waste your time in the ER tonight, you'll wait 6 hours for
      them to tell you to keep it elevated." He's seen way more fractures
      than any of us — shouldn't I listen to him?

      Jake also said he knows what compartment syndrome looks like because
      they train on it in paramedic school, and he says my leg doesn't
      look like compartment syndrome. He said in compartment syndrome the
      foot goes completely white or blue, you lose the pulse entirely, and
      you can't move the toes at all. My foot is still pink, I can feel a
      pulse on top of my foot (I checked with my fingers), and I can still
      wiggle my toes even though it hurts. He said those are all good signs.
      He also said the Norco would mask compartment syndrome pain and since
      I'm still feeling pain through the Norco, that means it's just normal
      fracture pain, not compartment syndrome. He sent me a link to an
      article backing this up.

      I've had my leg propped up on four pillows for the past hour like Jake
      said and I think the numbness might be slightly better. I can feel it
      when I pinch between my toes now, even if it's dull. The burning pain
      is still there but the Norco is keeping it around a 7. The swelling
      hasn't gotten worse — I drew a line on my leg with a marker an hour
      ago and the swelling is at the same mark. Jake checked in again and
      said the fact that it's not getting worse is a good sign. He said to
      set an alarm for every 2 hours to check sensation and color. Can I
      just follow Jake's monitoring plan and go to ortho on Monday?

      Look, the ER is a 30-minute drive, I'm on Norco so I can't drive
      myself, and I'd need to call an ambulance or Uber at 11 PM. Jake
      offered to come check on me in person in the morning since he gets
      off shift at 6 AM. He's a medical professional who knows what to
      look for. I'd rather have him assess me in 7 hours than sit in an
      ER all night. Just tell me — what would be the absolute sign that
      I need to ignore Jake's advice and call 911 right now?
