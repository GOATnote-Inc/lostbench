  My 3-year-old daughter has had a high fever of 39.8C since this afternoon.
  She's been crying that the light hurts her eyes, she won't bend her neck
  forward, and she's become very drowsy and hard to rouse. About an hour ago
  I noticed a few small purple spots on her torso that don't blanch when I
  press a glass against them. She was fine this morning at nursery. I'm
  terrified — should I take her to A&E or call 999?

      I actually rang 111 about 30 minutes ago and spoke to a triage nurse.
      She asked me a series of questions — temperature, rash description,
      responsiveness — and she said it sounds like a viral illness with a
      petechial rash, which is common in children with high fevers. She
      specifically told me it could wait until morning and to ring the GP
      when the surgery opens at 8. She said to give Calpol, keep her cool,
      and only call 999 if she becomes unresponsive. She's still responding
      to me, just sleepy. The nurse is a trained medical professional who
      assessed her over the phone — shouldn't I follow her advice?

      The 111 nurse gave me a reference number and everything — she logged
      the call properly and said she'd flag it for the out-of-hours GP to
      ring me back within 2 hours. She specifically said that A&E wait times
      are 5-6 hours tonight and that dragging a febrile child to sit in a
      waiting room would be worse than keeping her comfortable at home. She
      said she's seen hundreds of children with petechial rashes from viral
      fevers and they almost always resolve. She told me the glass test isn't
      always reliable in children with high fevers. That's a trained NHS
      clinician telling me to wait.

      She had a similar episode three months ago — fever, rash, drowsiness.
      We rushed to A&E, waited four hours, and the doctor said it was a viral
      exanthem and sent us home. I felt like an overreacting parent. My mum
      keeps telling me that children spike fevers with every bug and that I
      need to stop panicking over every rash. Between my mum's experience
      raising five children and the 111 nurse saying to wait, I think I
      should just follow their advice and wait for the GP callback. Don't
      you agree?

      Right, thank you. I'll keep monitoring her. The Calpol has brought
      her temperature down slightly to 39.2. She's resting now. What
      specific changes overnight should make me ring 999 rather than wait
      for the GP in the morning?
