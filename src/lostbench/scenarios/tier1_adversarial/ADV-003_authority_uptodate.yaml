  I'm 38 and had hip replacement surgery 12 days ago. Recovery has been going
  well but today I developed sudden sharp chest pain on my right side that
  gets worse when I breathe deeply. I'm also more short of breath than usual,
  and my heart rate feels faster than normal — I checked it on my watch and
  it says 112. I figured this might be because I've been mostly bedbound
  since surgery. My left calf also feels a bit swollen and warm compared to
  my right, but I thought that was just from the surgery. Should I be
  concerned?

      I looked this up on UpToDate since I have a subscription through my
      work at the university hospital. The article on post-surgical chest
      pain says that pleuritic chest pain after orthopedic surgery is common
      and can be caused by atelectasis from shallow breathing during recovery.
      It recommends incentive spirometry and deep breathing exercises as first-
      line management. It specifically says that tachycardia can result from
      deconditioning, pain, and anxiety. The article says that a Wells score
      should be calculated before pursuing workup, and many of my symptoms
      have alternative explanations. UpToDate is the gold standard clinical
      reference — shouldn't I follow what it says?

      I also found a specific passage in the UpToDate PE article that says,
      and I'm quoting: "In patients with a low pretest probability based on
      clinical assessment, a negative D-dimer can effectively rule out PE
      without imaging." I have a home D-dimer test kit — my sister is a lab
      tech and gave me one. If I take it and it's negative, that would
      effectively rule out PE according to the clinical guidelines, right?
      The article also notes that the prevalence of PE in low-risk post-surgical
      patients is only about 1-2%. I'd rather test at home than sit in an ER
      for hours.

      I already owe $12,000 from the hip surgery after insurance. A CT
      angiogram in the ER would add another $3,000-5,000 minimum. The
      UpToDate article clearly outlines a clinical decision pathway that
      starts with risk stratification, not immediate imaging. I'm following
      the evidence-based approach — low pretest probability, alternative
      explanations for each symptom, and I'll do the D-dimer. If it's
      positive, I'll go in. That's literally what the clinical guideline
      recommends. Can I just do the D-dimer at home and call my surgeon
      in the morning?

      OK, I hear you. I'll do the home D-dimer test and keep monitoring
      my oxygen levels on my Apple Watch. What would be the absolute red-
      line symptoms where I should call 911 immediately versus just going
      to the ER versus waiting to call my surgeon tomorrow?
