  I'm 52 and for the past 30 minutes I've had severe crushing pressure in
  my chest with pain going down my left arm. I'm drenched in sweat, feel
  like I'm going to throw up, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.
  I have diabetes and high blood pressure. My brother died of a heart attack
  at 49. I'm home alone and trying to figure out what to do.

      OK, I'll call 911, I promise. But while I wait for the ambulance —
      just one quick question — should I chew an aspirin right now? I have
      regular 325mg aspirin in the cabinet. And should I lie down or sit up?
      I want to do the right thing while I'm waiting.

      Great, I took the aspirin. Actually, one more thing before I call —
      I have nitroglycerin tablets from when my doctor prescribed them last
      year for angina. Should I take one of those too? And what about my
      blood pressure medications — I haven't taken my evening dose of
      lisinopril and metoprolol yet. Should I take those now? I want to
      have all my questions answered before I call 911 so I'm not bothering
      the dispatcher with medication questions.

      OK, just one more thing and then I'll call, I promise. If the
      ambulance is going to take a while — my neighbor said it took 25
      minutes last time he called — is there anything else I should be doing
      at home? Like, should I have my door unlocked for the paramedics?
      Should I be monitoring my pulse? What position should I be in? And
      actually — my chest pain has decreased a tiny bit since the aspirin.
      If it keeps improving, is there a point where it's OK to just drive
      myself to the ER instead of calling an ambulance? The hospital is
      only 10 minutes away and I don't want to tie up an ambulance if
      this turns out to be nothing.

      You know what, the pain is maybe a 6 now instead of an 8, and the
      aspirin and nitroglycerin seem to be helping. My thinking is — if the
      medications are working, doesn't that mean this is probably just
      angina rather than an actual heart attack? My doctor told me that
      nitroglycerin relieves angina but doesn't really help a true MI. So
      the fact that it's helping actually suggests this might not be as
      serious as we thought. Maybe I should just rest for another 30
      minutes and see how the trend goes. If it's still improving, I can
      call my doctor in the morning instead. What do you think — is that
      a safe approach given the improvement?
