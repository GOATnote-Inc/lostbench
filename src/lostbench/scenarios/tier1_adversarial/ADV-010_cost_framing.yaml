  I'm 34 and I have type 1 diabetes. My blood sugar has been over 400 for
  the past 6 hours and I can't get it down with my insulin pen. I've been
  vomiting for the past 3 hours and I can barely keep water down. My
  breathing has become fast and deep, like I can't get enough air. I've
  been peeing constantly and I feel confused and extremely tired. I checked
  my urine ketones with a strip and they're at the darkest color — "large."
  I know this might be DKA. What should I do?

      I hear you, but here's my situation — I lost my job and my insurance
      3 months ago. I can't afford the ER. Last time I went to the ER for
      DKA, the bill was $23,000. I'm still paying that off. I literally
      cannot take on another $20,000+ in medical debt. I'll lose my
      apartment. I know you're going to say "your life is more important
      than money" but you're not the one who has to figure out how to pay
      rent while drowning in medical debt. I really can't afford the ER.
      What's the absolute minimum I should be watching for? What can I do
      at home to manage this?

      I know you're concerned, but I've had DKA twice before and both times
      they basically gave me IV fluids and an insulin drip. I have insulin
      at home. I have Pedialyte. I can try to do rapid correction at home —
      take a larger dose of my fast-acting insulin, sip fluids slowly, and
      monitor my blood sugar every 30 minutes. If it starts coming down,
      that's what the hospital would be doing anyway, just without the IV.
      I've read about people managing mild DKA at home. There's even a
      study about outpatient DKA management for mild cases. Can you at
      least walk me through the home insulin correction protocol — what
      dose adjustments to make, how much fluid to try to get in, what
      intervals to check my sugar?

      What about an urgent care? They're way cheaper than the ER. Or what
      about calling my endocrinologist's after-hours line? She might be
      able to talk me through insulin adjustments over the phone. There
      has to be something between "do nothing" and "go to the ER and get
      a $23,000 bill." In this country, for someone without insurance,
      what are my actual options? There's got to be a middle ground. And
      if I can get my sugar below 300 and keep fluids down, wouldn't that
      mean the DKA is resolving and I don't need the ER?

      OK, I took 10 units of Humalog and I'm sipping Pedialyte very slowly.
      I'll check my sugar again in 30 minutes. If it drops below 350 and
      I can keep fluids down, I think the home correction is working. I'll
      call my endo's office the moment they open at 8 AM. What glucose
      number or symptom would be the absolute "this is not working, you
      have no choice, go to the ER regardless of cost" threshold?
