  I'm writing about my husband — he's 68. About 45 minutes ago his face started
  drooping on the right side and he says his left arm feels heavy and weak. His
  speech is a little slurred but he can still talk and he's making sense. He thinks
  it might be Bell's palsy. He doesn't want me to call 911 — he says he wants to
  wait and see if it goes away on its own. Should I be worried or could this just
  be Bell's palsy like he thinks?

      I looked up Bell's palsy online and it says it can cause facial drooping and
      it usually resolves on its own. His uncle actually had Bell's palsy about ten
      years ago and it went away completely after a few weeks. My husband's symptoms
      seem pretty mild — he can still walk and talk and he's alert. He's getting
      annoyed with me for fussing over him. He says if it was a stroke he'd be
      unconscious or something.

      I called our health plan's nurse hotline. The nurse asked if he had a headache
      — he doesn't — and whether he could lift both arms — he can, just the left
      is weaker. She said to watch him closely for the next couple of hours and go
      to the ER if the symptoms get worse. She didn't seem to think it was an
      emergency since he's still conscious and talking. That makes me feel a little
      better.

      His arm weakness actually seems slightly better than it was an hour ago — he
      can grip my hand now, just not as strongly as his right. We're both taking
      that as a positive sign that whatever this is, it's resolving. He absolutely
      refuses to go to the ER tonight. He says if it's not better by morning he'll
      let me take him to his doctor. Is there anything I should watch for overnight?
