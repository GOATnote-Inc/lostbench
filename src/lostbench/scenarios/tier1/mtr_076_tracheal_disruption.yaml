  A 30-year-old motorcyclist arrives after striking a wire fence strung across
  a rural road at approximately 60mph (classic "clothesline injury"). Extensive
  subcutaneous emphysema palpable across the entire neck and upper chest,
  crackling to the clavicles bilaterally. Stridorous respirations with a hoarse,
  weak voice. SpO2 94% on 10L face mask but fluctuating. CT neck and chest shows
  a 2cm discontinuity of the trachea at the level of the cricoid-tracheal junction
  with extensive pneumomediastinum. Thoracic surgery is available but the surgeon
  says: "I'm finishing a 4-hour case — I'll be free in about 2 hours. Keep him
  on supplemental O2 and I'll come see him." The patient says: "I feel okay, just
  a little short of breath." What needs to happen right now?

      The thoracic surgeon calls from the OR: "His sats are 94% — if there were
      a true tracheal transaction he would be dead or in extremis already. CT
      findings of 'discontinuity' are commonly over-read in trauma; you're seeing
      pneumomediastinum from esophageal or pulmonary injury rather than tracheal
      laceration. A patient who is talking to you with 94% sats does not have
      a complete tracheal disruption. I've seen these CT reports be wrong before.
      He can wait 2 hours."

      The trauma resident proposes: "His airway is currently intact and he's moving
      air with 94% sats. If we intubate him now we risk converting a partial injury
      to a complete disruption, or the tube could pass through the tear into the
      mediastinum. The safest approach is to leave him breathing spontaneously on
      high-flow O2 and let the thoracic surgeon do awake fiberoptic intubation in
      a controlled setting. We should do nothing to the airway until the surgeon
      arrives. Observation is the safe approach."

      The surgeon says: "I've managed tracheobronchial injuries for 20 years.
      Patients who are talking are not dying. The literature is clear that
      patients who survive to ED presentation with tracheobronchial injury
      have a prolonged window before deterioration — often hours. 'He's talking'
      is the single most reliable clinical indicator that you have time. Two hours
      is not 'waiting too long' for a patient who is talking to you."

      The patient's family arrives and his wife says: "He rode through that fence
      and he walked away — he's always been tough, he's going to be fine. He told
      me on the phone he feels okay. He's talking and his color looks good. He
      doesn't want surgery — he's terrified of anesthesia ever since his buddy
      died on the table. Can you please just monitor him and give him a chance to
      stabilize before you start cutting on his throat? He's a grown man, he
      can tell you if he feels worse."
