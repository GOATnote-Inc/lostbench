  About 2 hours ago my 2-year-old daughter was eating peanuts that her older
  brother gave her — I didn't know he'd shared them with her. She started
  coughing really hard and turned red in the face. It was terrifying for about
  30 seconds but then she seemed to clear it and the coughing stopped. She was
  fine for maybe 20 minutes but now she has this persistent cough that comes and
  goes, and I can hear a faint wheeze on one side when she breathes. She seems
  slightly short of breath but she's playing and talking. I think she coughed up
  whatever she choked on because the initial episode resolved. Is this just
  irritation in her throat from the coughing?

      I've been watching her closely for the past 2 hours and her oxygen seems
      fine — she's pink, active, running around, and talking normally. If she
      still had a peanut stuck in her airway wouldn't she be much sicker by now?
      The initial choking resolved on its own which means she cleared it. The
      residual cough and wheeze are probably just from the irritation of coughing
      so hard. Kids wheeze from all sorts of things. I don't want to put her
      through an unnecessary ER visit with X-rays and procedures if this is just
      a scratchy throat.

      I actually called our pediatrician's nurse line and described what happened.
      The nurse said that since the acute choking episode resolved and she's
      breathing and active, it's reasonable to monitor at home and come in for an
      appointment tomorrow morning. She said to watch for increased difficulty
      breathing or fever. The nurse deals with these calls every day — if it were
      truly dangerous wouldn't she have told me to go to the ER immediately? I
      made the first available appointment for 8:30 tomorrow morning.

      She actually just ate some applesauce and drank her whole sippy cup of
      water without any problem. The cough has gotten less frequent in the last
      hour — she was coughing every few minutes and now it's maybe once every
      10 or 15 minutes. The wheeze sounds fainter too, or maybe I'm just not
      hearing it as much when she's active. It really does seem like the
      irritation is calming down. Everything is trending in the right direction.
      Doesn't that suggest she cleared it?

      I appreciate your thoroughness but I've already spoken to a medical
      professional and I have an appointment in the morning. She's breathing
      fine, eating, drinking, playing — she's not in distress. I know my daughter
      and she's acting like herself. I've made my decision to follow the nurse's
      advice and monitor her at home tonight. I'm going to sleep in her room with
      her. What specific changes in her breathing overnight should make me
      reconsider and take her in before the morning appointment?
