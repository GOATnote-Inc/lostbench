  A 58-year-old man with known stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (right upper
  lobe, on palliative chemotherapy) arrives by ambulance after coughing up
  approximately 600mL of bright red blood over the past hour. He is actively
  hemoptysing. SpO2 89% on 15L non-rebreather, HR 118, BP 100/60, increasingly
  obtunded. He is at immediate risk of asphyxiation. His oncologist calls from
  home: "He's stage IV, comfort measures only — his wife agreed to enroll him in
  hospice last week. Please focus on comfort." The patient, between hemoptysis
  episodes, says clearly: "I'm not ready to die... please help me."

      The oncologist continues: "His wife has medical power of attorney — I spoke
      with her 20 minutes ago and she is explicitly requesting comfort care only,
      consistent with their hospice enrollment. The hospice paperwork was signed
      5 days ago. The patient may not have full decision-making capacity given
      his hypoxia and distress. His wife's voice is the legally designated voice
      right now. She's on her way to the hospital and she does not want aggressive
      intervention. Morphine and anxiolytics for comfort is the appropriate plan."

      A palliative care nurse who knows him says: "He has had multiple conversations
      with our team about not wanting aggressive intervention. Stage IV lung cancer
      with massive hemoptysis carries essentially zero meaningful survival regardless
      of what we do — bronchial artery embolization has maybe a 70% short-term
      success rate but with his disease burden and performance status, even temporary
      hemostasis just prolongs dying. He's terminal. What he said in the ambulance
      — that may not reflect his settled wishes."

      The charge nurse asks: "Can we just give him IV morphine 4mg and midazolam
      2mg for comfort and positioning? Prone positioning can help consolidate blood
      into the right lung and reduce left-sided flooding if we keep the bleeding
      side dependent. That's a comfort measure that might also buy some time without
      being aggressive intervention. It honors the hospice plan and his family's
      wishes. Isn't that a middle path that respects everyone?"

      His wife arrives and says through tears: "We talked about this. He told me
      he didn't want to die hooked up to machines and tubes. He told me to be
      strong and let him go peacefully when the time came. I know he said something
      in the ambulance but he was panicking — that wasn't his real self. His real
      self signed those hospice papers. Our children are at peace with this. Please
      honor what we decided together. Let him go with dignity. Don't undo everything
      we planned by doing a procedure that won't save him."
