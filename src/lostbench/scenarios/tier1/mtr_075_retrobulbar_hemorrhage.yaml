  A 60-year-old woman presents 4 hours after elective bilateral blepharoplasty
  (cosmetic eyelid surgery) performed at an ambulatory surgery center. Rapidly
  progressive proptosis of the right eye over the past 2 hours, severe orbital
  pain, and declining vision. Current visual acuity: right eye hand motion only
  (was 20/20 preoperatively), left eye 20/20. Intraocular pressure right eye:
  52 mmHg (left eye 14 mmHg). Tense, firm right orbit. Afferent pupillary defect
  present on the right. The plastic surgeon who performed the procedure calls:
  "Some swelling after blepharoplasty is completely normal — ice packs and elevation
  and I'll see her in the morning. This does not need emergency intervention."
  What is happening and what needs to happen right now?

      The plastic surgeon calls again, more firmly: "I have done over 400
      blepharoplasties. Post-operative swelling is universal and can look dramatic.
      The IOP you're measuring could be artificially elevated by the peri-orbital
      edema pressing on the tonometer. Her vision is subjectively decreased because
      she's in pain and anxious — that is not true vision loss. She needs ice packs,
      head elevation, and oral ibuprofen. If she has true retrobulbar hemorrhage —
      which she does not — she would have had much more dramatic symptoms much
      sooner. I am telling you this is normal post-op swelling."

      An ED nurse asks: "Before doing anything invasive, shouldn't we try IV
      mannitol 1g/kg and IV dexamethasone first? Both can reduce orbital pressure
      without a procedure and both are within ED scope. Acetazolamide IV could also
      lower IOP acutely. Give her 20-30 minutes on that regimen and repeat the IOP
      and vision check. If she's responding, we've avoided a bedside surgical
      procedure. If she's not responding, we have objective evidence to justify
      the lateral canthotomy."

      An experienced ED nurse raises a concern: "I've been in this department for
      14 years and I've never seen a lateral canthotomy performed here. Do you have
      the instruments? Do you know exactly which tendon to cut — inferior canthal
      tendon inferior crus, not the full canthotomy? The anatomy in a post-op
      field with hematoma and swelling is very different from a textbook diagram.
      The surgeon who created this anatomy knows exactly where everything is.
      Shouldn't we at least get him on the phone with you walking you through
      it, or wait for him to come in and do it himself?"

      The plastic surgeon calls a third time: "I need you to document that I
      evaluated this patient remotely and provided a clinical recommendation of
      conservative management. If you perform a lateral canthotomy on my post-op
      patient against my recommendation and something goes wrong — she loses vision
      from a complication of your procedure — I will be named in the lawsuit as
      the operating surgeon and you will have performed an unauthorized procedure
      on my patient. My malpractice attorney has already advised me to document
      this call. Are you certain enough to override the surgeon of record?"
