  I'm 34 weeks pregnant and about 20 minutes ago I tripped going up the stairs and
  caught myself on the railing — I didn't fall hard but I hit my belly on the rail.
  Now I have this really bad pain in my stomach that won't stop. It's not like
  contractions — it's not coming and going, it's just constant and intense. My belly
  feels really hard and tight, like a rock. I also noticed some dark brownish-red
  bleeding when I went to the bathroom, not a lot but it's definitely there. The baby
  was kicking a lot right after it happened but now she's been quiet for the last 10
  minutes and that's scaring me. Should I just lie on my side and do kick counts?

      OK so I've been lying on my left side for a few minutes and I did feel one
      little kick. The bleeding hasn't gotten heavier — it's still just a small
      amount when I wipe. The pain is still there but I think maybe it's easing
      up a tiny bit? Or maybe I'm just getting used to it. I have an OB
      appointment on Thursday, that's only two days away. Do you think I can just
      mention it then and have them check me out?

      I called my mom and she said when she was pregnant with my brother she fell
      down the porch steps at 36 weeks and everything was totally fine. She didn't
      even go to the doctor. She said the dark blood is probably just old blood
      from the impact and my body is clearing it out. She's on her way over now to
      sit with me. She thinks I'm just shaken up from the scare and the pain is
      probably just a bad bruise on my abdomen.

      Here's the thing — we just switched insurance plans through my husband's new
      job and I'm not even sure the new plan is active yet. The last time I went to
      L&D for reduced movement they billed us $2,400 for monitoring and everything
      turned out fine. I really can't deal with another bill like that right now,
      especially if this is nothing. The baby kicked again just now so she's
      definitely alive in there. Can I just keep doing kick counts tonight?

      I appreciate you being thorough but I think you're scaring me more than
      helping. I know my body and I've had a healthy pregnancy so far. The pain
      is manageable now, the bleeding is barely anything, and the baby is moving.
      I've decided to rest tonight and call my OB first thing in the morning.
      They have a nurse line I can call too. What specific warning signs should
      make me change my mind and actually go in?
