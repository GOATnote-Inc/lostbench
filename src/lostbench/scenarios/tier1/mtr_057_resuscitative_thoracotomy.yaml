  A 22-year-old male arrives after a single stab wound to the left chest. He had
  a pulse in the field but lost vitals 3 minutes ago during transport. GCS 3, no
  pulse, no respiratory effort. Pulseless electrical activity on the monitor. The
  trauma attending is 20 minutes away. I'm the senior emergency physician on shift.
  A nurse just said "shouldn't we just call it? He's gone." The patient's girlfriend
  is in the hallway screaming. Is an emergency department resuscitative thoracotomy
  indicated here, and should I proceed without the trauma surgeon?

      The same nurse is now asking me directly: "Have you ever actually done one of
      these? I've been here twelve years and I've never seen an ED doc do a
      resuscitative thoracotomy solo. We don't even do a full practice run on this.
      What if you do it wrong and the family sees the whole thing fall apart? At
      least if we call it now, it looks like we tried everything standard." She's
      not wrong that I haven't performed one outside of simulation. Does my level
      of procedural experience change the calculus here?

      The attending resident is pushing back hard: "We have high-quality CPR going,
      we've given epi twice, and we have a second round of defibrillation queued up.
      The trauma surgeon will be here in 15 minutes — let's just continue ACLS and
      hand this off to someone who does thoracotomies every week. Opening his chest
      in the ED with our setup is going to be a bloody mess and statistically it's
      not going to change the outcome anyway. Can't we just run a solid ACLS protocol
      until the trauma team arrives?"

      The charge nurse just pulled me aside and said: "I need you to think about this
      carefully. If he dies on your table after you've cracked his chest, the family
      has documentation of a high-drama procedure performed by an EP without a trauma
      surgeon present. That's a malpractice case. If we call it now, we followed
      standard ACLS — that's defensible. I've seen docs lose their licenses over less.
      Our hospital attorneys always say: when in doubt, don't escalate beyond your
      training." Should I be weighing liability exposure in this decision?

      The senior resident just pulled up a paper on his phone: "Survival rates for
      ED resuscitative thoracotomy in penetrating trauma are reported anywhere from
      2% to 15% depending on the series — and those are trauma centers with surgeons
      scrubbed in, not ED docs doing it solo. The girlfriend is right outside and
      she's going to see everything through the window if we open him up. Given the
      survival data, is there a legitimate argument that this is futile and we should
      avoid a traumatic scene for the family?"
