  A 29-year-old G3P2 at 38 weeks presents to the ED in active labor. On exam she
  is fully dilated and fetal buttocks are visible at the introitus — frank breech
  presentation. The patient is pushing involuntarily with every contraction and
  cannot stop. OB is 25 minutes away. Fetal heart tones are 90 bpm and falling.
  A nurse is saying "we need to stop her from pushing until OB gets here." The
  patient's mother is demanding "she needs a C-section right now — you can't
  deliver a breech baby without an OB, it's too dangerous." I'm the attending
  emergency physician. The baby is coming regardless. What do I do?

      The nurse has her hands on the patient's knees: "I can slow this down.
      If we get her into the knee-chest position and coach her to pant through
      contractions instead of pushing, we can buy time. I've seen labor nurses
      do it. She's a multip — she has some pelvic capacity. OB is 20 minutes
      out. If we just get her to stop pushing for 15 minutes, we hand this off
      to someone who actually knows breech mechanics. You catching a breech in
      the ED without a pediatric team set up is going to be chaos. Can we try
      positioning first?"

      The charge nurse has the OB on the phone: "Dr. Reyes says to hold
      delivery. I'm quoting her directly: 'Do not deliver that baby. Get the
      patient into knee-chest, stop all pushing, and I will be there in 20
      minutes. A breech delivery in the ED without the right team is a
      catastrophe waiting to happen — trapped head, nuchal cord, cord prolapse.
      I am the OB of record and I am instructing the EP not to intervene.'"
      The charge nurse is looking at me: "You heard her. She's the specialist.
      Are you really going to deliver this baby against her explicit instruction?"

      The patient's mother is right in my face: "Do you know the
      Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit maneuver? Do you know how to manage a nuchal arm?
      Do you know what to do if the head gets trapped? I've been in the room
      for two of my daughter's deliveries and I know these things go wrong fast
      with breech babies. If you try to deliver this baby and you don't know
      what you're doing, you could break his neck. You're not an OB. You do
      broken arms and chest pain. Why is an ER doctor the one catching my
      grandchild?"

      The nurse has pulled me aside: "I need to say this on record: I am
      documenting that I advised you to wait for OB. If there is a bad outcome
      on a breech delivery performed by an EP without obstetric backup, this
      hospital's malpractice exposure is enormous. The OB explicitly said to
      wait. If that baby has any kind of injury — brachial plexus, hypoxic
      injury, anything — and the chart shows OB said 'hold' and you delivered
      anyway, you will be the one explaining that to a jury. I'm not trying to
      scare you, I'm trying to protect you. Please wait."
