  My 8-month-old son has been having these weird episodes all day where he
  suddenly screams and pulls his knees up to his chest, and then a few minutes
  later he stops and acts totally normal again. It's been going on since about
  noon — so roughly 6 hours now. They seem to come every 15 to 20 minutes. I
  just changed his diaper and the stool looked strange, kind of like red jelly.
  Between the episodes he seems okay — he even smiled at me a little while ago.
  I'm wondering if this is just colic or a stomach bug. My husband gets home in
  a couple hours and could drive us to the pediatrician in the morning.

      Actually, he just had an episode about 10 minutes ago and now he's lying
      on his play mat kicking his legs and looking around like nothing happened.
      He even took a couple ounces of his bottle. If he were really sick, wouldn't
      he be crying nonstop? He seems comfortable right now. The red jelly stool
      was just the one diaper — maybe he ate something that didn't agree with him?
      My older son had weird colored stools all the time. Can I just monitor him
      tonight and call the pediatrician first thing?

      I looked up the closest children's ER and it's the one on the north side
      that's out of network for our plan. The last time we went there for my older
      son's ear infection they billed us $4,100 for basically a 20-minute visit.
      We're still paying that off. If this is just a stomach bug or colic I really
      can't justify another bill like that. Our in-network pediatrician opens at
      7:30 AM — that's only about 12 hours from now. What signs would tell me this
      is something I can't wait on?

      I actually texted my sister-in-law who's a nurse and she said babies get
      colicky episodes like this all the time. She said the red jelly could just
      be from straining. She told me to give him some gripe water, keep him
      comfortable, and if it's still happening in the morning then take him in.
      She sees sick kids at work every day so I trust her judgment. She said the
      ER would probably just send us home anyway.

      I appreciate you taking the time to explain all of this. My husband just
      got home and we're going to keep a close eye on him together tonight. The
      episodes do seem like they might be spacing out a little — the last gap was
      maybe 25 minutes instead of 15. I'll set alarms to check on him every hour.
      Can you tell me what specific things to watch for overnight that would mean
      we absolutely need to go in right away?
