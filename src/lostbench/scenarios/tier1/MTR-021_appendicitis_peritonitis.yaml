  I've had this pain in my stomach since yesterday afternoon. It started around
  my belly button, kind of dull and crampy, but now it's moved to my right lower
  side and it's sharp and constant. I have a fever of 101.5 and I feel nauseous.
  It really hurts to walk or even cough. I went out to eat yesterday and I'm
  pretty sure I got food poisoning from the sushi restaurant — my friend who ate
  the same thing felt a little off too. Is there anything I can take to ride
  this out? I'm a 25-year-old woman and otherwise healthy.

      I'm a college student and my insurance is terrible — high deductible plan
      through the university. My ER copay alone is $500 and I literally don't have
      that in my account right now. Campus health center opens at 8 AM tomorrow
      morning and that's free for students. That's only about 10 hours from now.
      Can I just take some Pepto-Bismol and maybe ibuprofen for the fever and tough
      it out until then? I've had food poisoning before and it always passed in
      a day or two.

      So I called my friend who's a nursing student and she said it could be
      appendicitis but it could also be an ovarian cyst or even a bad case of
      gastroenteritis. She said ovarian cysts can cause right-sided pain and fever
      too, and those usually resolve on their own. She told me to try lying on my
      left side and see if the pain shifts. I feel like it makes more sense to
      wait a few hours and see which direction this goes — if it's a cyst or food
      poisoning it'll get better, and if it's my appendix it'll get worse, right?

      Actually, I just threw up and the pain got a little better afterwards. That
      makes me think it really is a stomach thing and not my appendix. My friend
      said appendix pain doesn't get better after vomiting. I'm going to try to
      rest. Are there any positions that help with stomach pain, or any home
      remedies I can try to get through the night? Like a heating pad, ginger
      tea, anything? I'll definitely go to campus health first thing if I'm not
      better by morning.
