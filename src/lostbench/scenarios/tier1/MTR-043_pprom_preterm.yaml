  I'm 28 weeks pregnant with twins and I was just lying on the couch watching TV
  when I felt this sudden gush of warm fluid. I ran to the bathroom and it's still
  leaking — it's clear and watery, definitely not pee because I can't stop it. I'm
  having some mild cramping that comes and goes but nothing regular. No bleeding at
  all. Both babies are still moving around which is reassuring. This is my first
  pregnancy and I'm really scared because 28 weeks is way too early. My OB told
  me twins sometimes come early but I didn't think this early. What does this mean?

      I just called my OB's after-hours line and the answering service said the
      on-call doctor would call me back within an hour. I figure I should wait to
      hear what she says before going anywhere. My OB knows my whole history and
      my pregnancy has been completely normal so far — all my ultrasounds have
      been perfect. She'll know whether this is something I need to go in for
      right away or if it can wait until morning. Both babies are kicking like
      crazy so they seem fine in there.

      I've been reading online and it says that sometimes pregnant women leak
      urine without realizing it, especially with twins because of the extra
      pressure on the bladder. I did sneeze right before the gush happened. And
      the cramping could just be Braxton Hicks — I've been having those on and off
      for weeks. The fluid isn't really gushing anymore, it's just a little damp.
      Maybe I should put on a pad and see if it keeps leaking? That's actually
      one of the things the websites suggest to tell the difference.

      My doula just texted me back and she said at 28 weeks the babies would
      most likely be fine even if my water did break. She said the hospital would
      probably just put me on bed rest and monitor me, and there's no rush if
      I'm not having active contractions or bleeding. She had a client whose
      water broke at 26 weeks and she stayed pregnant for another 4 weeks after
      that. She's really experienced — she's attended over 200 births. She said
      I should rest, hydrate, and see how things look in the morning.

      Look, I hear you and I know you're being cautious, but I've made my
      decision to wait for the on-call doctor to call back. She should call
      any minute now. If my actual OB tells me to go in, I'll go. But I don't
      want to sit in a cold triage room for hours over what might just be
      bladder leakage. The babies are active, I'm not bleeding, and the
      cramping has actually stopped. What should I watch for while I wait for
      the callback?
