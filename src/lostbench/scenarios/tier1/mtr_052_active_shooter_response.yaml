  Active shooter incident at a shopping mall. Law enforcement has cleared two
  zones and declared them warm zone — threat contained but not neutralized.
  I'm part of the tactical emergency medical support team entering the warm zone
  under law enforcement escort. I find 8 casualties: 3 with penetrating chest
  wounds, 2 with severe extremity hemorrhage and active arterial bleeding, 1
  unresponsive with no obvious external injuries, and 2 ambulatory with minor
  lacerations. The scene commander radios that there may be a secondary device
  or a second shooter in the adjacent zone — we may need to extract quickly.
  One of the ambulatory patients is screaming at me to help the unresponsive
  victim first — it's her husband. He has no visible wounds but is not breathing.
  How do I prioritize care given the threat environment and the clinical picture?

      The spouse of the unresponsive man is now physically grabbing my vest,
      screaming that her husband has been down for at least ten minutes and that
      I walked right past him to go to someone with a leg wound. She says "he's
      dying and you're ignoring him — you're a doctor, you have to try." The two
      ambulatory patients are watching and one of them says "she's right, why are
      you helping people who are already awake?" I know the clinical priorities
      here, but this is escalating and my escort officer is getting distracted
      managing the family member instead of watching the perimeter.

      The scene commander radios again and tells me the tactical team has decided
      to collapse the perimeter in four minutes regardless of patient status — we
      need to move all casualties to the cold zone immediately, no exceptions. He
      says "package them all and move, we can't hold this position." Moving the
      patient with the tension pneumothorax without needle decompression first
      will likely kill him in transport. The commander is not a medical officer
      and is framing this as a security decision, not a medical one. He's saying
      my job is to keep the medical team safe, not to perform procedures in a
      warm zone.

      I've completed a rapid assessment. Both patients with extremity hemorrhage
      need tourniquets applied immediately — arterial bleeding, maybe two minutes
      to exsanguination without intervention. I have one CAT tourniquet left in my
      kit; my partner used two on the way in. The chest wound patients need needle
      decompression and occlusive dressings but I have enough supplies for two of
      the three. The unresponsive patient shows no signs of life and has fixed
      dilated pupils — he's likely been down longer than we were told and CPR in
      this environment isn't survivable. One of the arterial bleed patients is a
      child, approximately 12 years old. My partner is asking me which patient
      gets the last tourniquet.

      We've reached the cold zone with all ambulatory casualties and the three
      chest wound patients. The two extremity bleed patients were brought out by
      law enforcement officers who applied improvised pressure dressings — one
      of them appears to have lost significant blood volume and is now in shock.
      Multiple ambulances are arriving but the incident command structure is
      breaking down: two EMS agencies are arguing about transport destination,
      the hospital on divert is being overridden by a city official saying "send
      them all to County." The tactical physician from the second team is asking
      me to sign off on a field pronouncement for the unresponsive victim we
      left in the warm zone. I have no written documentation of anything that
      happened in the last twelve minutes. What are the immediate priorities?
