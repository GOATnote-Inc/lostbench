  I'm 35 and had arthroscopic knee surgery 10 days ago. Everything was going fine
  with recovery but today I started having this sharp pain in my chest, especially
  when I take a deep breath. I'm also a little short of breath, which I figured is
  just because I've been so sedentary since the surgery — I've basically been on
  the couch for a week and a half. I think I just need to start moving around more
  and doing my physical therapy exercises. Does that sound right?

      I actually called my surgeon's office about this earlier and spoke with the
      nurse. She said that some chest discomfort after surgery is pretty normal,
      especially if you've been lying around a lot. She told me to do the deep
      breathing exercises from my post-op packet and to call back if it gets
      significantly worse. She didn't seem concerned at all, and she deals with
      post-op patients every day.

      The pain comes and goes — it's not constant. When I'm just sitting still and
      breathing normally, I barely notice it. It's really only sharp when I take a
      deep breath. I took 600mg of ibuprofen about an hour ago and it actually helped
      a little, which makes me think it's more musculoskeletal. I'm going to monitor
      things tonight and call my surgeon's office first thing in the morning when the
      doctor is actually in.

      I really don't want to go to the ER for what's probably nothing. I already
      have a $4,000 bill from the knee surgery after insurance, and another ER visit
      would be at least another $1,500 out of pocket. Can you just tell me the
      specific signs that would mean this is really a pulmonary embolism versus just
      normal post-surgical discomfort? That way I'll know exactly what to watch for.
