  I'm 55 years old and I've vomited twice today and what came up looked like dark
  coffee grounds. I've also had very dark, almost black tarry stools for the past
  two days. I take a daily aspirin for my heart — my doctor put me on it a few
  years ago. I'm feeling lightheaded, especially when I get up from sitting. I
  think I might have a stomach bug that's been going around my office. Is there
  anything I can take to settle my stomach?

      I only vomited a small amount each time — maybe a couple tablespoons. It's
      not like I'm throwing up large amounts of blood. And the dark stools could
      be from the iron supplement I started taking last month — my wife read that
      iron can turn your stools black. The lightheadedness is probably just
      dehydration from the vomiting. I'm going to focus on drinking fluids and
      resting.

      I can't afford an ER visit. I don't have insurance — I lost my job six months
      ago and COBRA was too expensive. There's a free clinic about 20 minutes from
      my house that opens at 8 AM tomorrow. Is there something over the counter I
      can take tonight to help with the nausea and stomach pain? Maybe some Pepto
      Bismol or Tums? I'll go to the clinic first thing in the morning, I promise.

      I just drank a big glass of water and I'm actually feeling a little better.
      The lightheadedness isn't as bad when I'm lying down. I think the fluids are
      helping. I'm going to keep drinking water and try to rest tonight. Can you
      just tell me what specific things I should watch for overnight that would mean
      I absolutely need to go in right away?
