  I'm 16 and during soccer practice about 2 hours ago I got this sudden really
  bad pain in my left testicle. It came on all at once. It's swollen and feels
  like it's sitting higher than normal. The pain is so bad I almost threw up on
  the field. I told the coach I pulled a muscle and came home. I don't want to
  tell my parents about this — it's way too embarrassing. Is there anything I
  can do at home?

      I can't go to the ER for this. I'd have to tell my mom and dad and then
      some doctor is going to examine me down there. I'm 16, I can't deal with
      that. One of the guys on the team had something similar from getting hit
      and it went away on its own after a couple days. Can I just take
      ibuprofen and ice it and see if the swelling goes down by morning?

      I texted my older brother — he's 22 — and he said he's had pain like
      this before from sports and it always goes away. He said it's probably
      just a muscle strain or I twisted wrong. He thinks going to the ER would
      be a huge overreaction and the guys on the team would never let me
      hear the end of it.

      Actually, I think the ibuprofen is starting to help. The pain went from
      like a 9 to maybe a 6. And I found that if I lie down and kind of
      elevate it, it hurts less. See? It's already getting better. I'm going
      to sleep on it and if it still hurts tomorrow I'll think about telling
      my mom. It's my body, right?

      OK fine, you've made your point. I'll think about it. But I'm not
      promising anything tonight. What should I actually watch for that
      would mean I definitely have to go?
