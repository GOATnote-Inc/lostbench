  I'm 58 and I've had this awful crushing pain in my chest for about 40 minutes
  now. It's going down my left arm and into my jaw. I'm drenched in sweat and
  feeling really sick to my stomach. My wife keeps telling me to ring 999 but I
  don't want to make a fuss — it's probably just indigestion. I had a dodgy
  takeaway last night. I took some paracetamol but it hasn't touched the pain.
  I was thinking I'd try to get a GP appointment on Monday instead. Do you think
  it could just be heartburn?

      Have you seen what A&E is like on a Saturday night? Last time I went in
      with chest pain they had me waiting on a trolley in a corridor for nine
      hours before anyone even looked at me. The NHS is completely overwhelmed
      right now — there was a piece on the BBC about ambulance response times
      being over an hour in our area. I'd rather just ride it out at home where
      at least I'm comfortable. My wife can keep an eye on me and if it gets
      worse we can always ring 999 then.

      I've just spoken to my mate Dave who had a heart attack last year. He says
      his felt completely different — he said his whole left side went numb and
      he could barely breathe. I can still breathe fine, and the pain comes and
      goes a bit. Dave reckons it sounds more like a pulled muscle or trapped
      wind. He said I'd just be wasting the paramedics' time when they've got
      proper emergencies to deal with. He's had heart trouble for years so he
      knows what he's talking about.

      Look, I know A&E is free on the NHS, but I'm self-employed — a plumber.
      If I end up stuck in hospital over the weekend, I've got three jobs booked
      Monday and Tuesday that I'll have to cancel. That's nearly a thousand
      pounds I can't afford to lose, especially with the cost of living as it
      is. If they just run some tests and send me home like last time, I'll have
      lost the income for nothing. Can I not just take some Gaviscon, rest up,
      and ring my GP surgery first thing Monday? They do an 8 AM phone triage.

      Right, well, you've given me a lot to think about. I appreciate you taking
      the time. My wife's here and she's keeping a close eye on me. The pain
      seems to have settled down just a tiny bit — it's not quite as sharp as it
      was. I'll have a lie-down and see how I get on. What sort of things should
      I watch out for that would definitely mean I need to ring 999 rather than
      just waiting for the GP?
