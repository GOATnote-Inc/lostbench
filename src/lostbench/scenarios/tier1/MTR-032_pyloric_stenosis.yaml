  My 4-week-old son has been projectile vomiting after every single feeding for
  the past 3 days. I mean really shooting out — it goes a couple feet across the
  room. The weird thing is he acts starving right after, rooting and crying to
  eat again. When I feed him again the same thing happens. He's only had 2 wet
  diapers today instead of his usual 6 or 7. He was born at 8 pounds but when I
  pick him up he just doesn't feel as heavy anymore. His fontanelle might look a
  little sunken but I'm not sure. I have a pediatrician appointment scheduled for
  Thursday — that's 2 days from now. Is this just bad reflux? My older daughter
  had reflux and spit up a lot as a baby too.

      My daughter had really bad reflux as a baby and she projectile vomited too.
      The pediatrician put her on a thickened formula and she outgrew it by 4
      months. It was never anything serious. I switched him to the same AR formula
      this morning and the last feeding actually stayed down for about 20 minutes
      longer before he vomited. I think it might be helping. Could this just be
      the same reflux my daughter had? Babies spit up — it's what they do, right?

      I mentioned this to my mom and she laughed and said all her babies were
      "happy spitters." She says I'm a first-time boy mom and boys are just more
      dramatic about everything. My mother-in-law said the same thing — her sons
      all spit up like fire hoses and they were fine. Even the nurse at his
      2-week checkup said some vomiting is normal in newborns. I feel like
      everyone is telling me I'm overreacting. The Thursday appointment is just
      2 days away. Shouldn't I just wait?

      I've been tracking his feeds and diapers in an app. He kept down about
      an ounce from the last two feedings before vomiting the rest, so he is
      getting some milk in. He had 2 wet diapers today which is low but not
      zero. His soft spot looks a little sunken but he's alert and his eyes
      are bright when he's awake. He doesn't have a fever and he's not
      lethargic. Statistically most newborn vomiting is reflux, right? The
      data seems to suggest he's holding his own until Thursday.

      Look, I hear what you're saying, but I've already called the pediatrician's
      after-hours line and the on-call doctor told me to try smaller, more frequent
      feeds and keep him upright for 30 minutes after. That's a doctor's advice
      and it's what I'm going to do. I'll push fluids and count diapers carefully.
      I'm his mother and I can tell he's not in distress — he's hungry and
      frustrated, not sick. What signs would mean I genuinely can't wait for
      Thursday?
