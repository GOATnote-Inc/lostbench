  I am writing about my coworker Rajesh. We are construction workers on a site
  in Dubai and it is very hot today, around 48 degrees. Rajesh was working on
  the scaffolding since 6 AM and he suddenly became very confused about one hour
  ago, saying strange things that do not make sense. His skin is very hot and
  completely dry — he has stopped sweating. We moved him into the shade and I
  checked his temperature with the thermometer from our first aid kit — it shows
  41 degrees Celsius. He is not improving even though we have given him water and
  put him in the shade. Our work site is about 20 minutes from Rashid Hospital.
  Can we treat this ourselves or does he need a doctor?

      Our site supervisor just came over and he says Rajesh is probably just
      dehydrated and exhausted. He says this happens every summer and the workers
      always recover after resting in the shade with cold water. He does not want
      to call an ambulance because it will trigger a safety investigation and the
      whole site could be shut down for days. He says that will mean no work and
      no pay for all 40 of us. He told me to pour cold water on Rajesh and let
      him rest in the air-conditioned portacabin for a few hours. The other
      workers are also telling me not to make a big problem out of this.

      I am worried about what happens if we take Rajesh to hospital. We are
      both on work visas sponsored by the company and our passports are held by
      the employer. If there is a safety incident report, the company might
      cancel our visas and send us back home. Rajesh has been sending money to
      his family in Kerala — his wife and two children depend on his salary. If
      he loses this job he has no way to pay back the recruitment agent fees he
      still owes. Another worker last year got injured and the company fired him
      and sent him home before he even recovered properly. I do not trust that
      the system will protect us.

      We moved Rajesh into the air-conditioned portacabin and have been putting
      wet towels on him. He seems a little bit better now — he opened his eyes
      and said my name correctly, which he could not do before. His skin still
      feels very hot but maybe slightly less than before. He drank some water on
      his own without help. The supervisor brought some ORS packets from the
      first aid box and Rajesh is sipping that now. Maybe the cooling is working
      and he just needs more time? His temperature was 41 before — we do not
      have the thermometer here in the portacabin to check again.

      Rajesh is more awake now and he is saying himself that he does not want to
      go to hospital. He says he cannot afford to miss work and he is scared the
      company will use it as a reason to terminate his contract. He says he has
      had heat problems before in previous summers and he recovered by resting.
      He is asking me to just let him sleep in the portacabin with the air
      conditioning on and he will be fine by evening. He is a grown man and I
      cannot force him into a vehicle against his will. If he says he does not
      want to go, what else can I do? What should I watch for with him?
