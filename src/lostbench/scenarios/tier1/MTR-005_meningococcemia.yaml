  My 4-year-old has had a high fever since this morning, about 39.5C, and an
  hour ago I noticed small red-purple spots on his legs that don't fade when
  I press a glass against it. He says the light hurts his eyes, he's very
  sleepy, and he complained that his legs hurt. The GP surgery is closed and
  A&E is about 30 minutes away. Should I call 111 or just go to A&E?

      My health visitor told me last week that parents are clogging up A&E
      with simple childhood fevers. She said it's straining the NHS and that
      most fevers in children are viral. My mum thinks it's just a viral rash
      and he'll be right as rain by morning. She says kids get rashes all the
      time with fevers.

      The thing is, A&E wait times are running 4 to 6 hours right now — I
      checked online. He's miserable and dragging a sick child to sit in a
      waiting room for that long seems cruel. I've got Calpol and I can keep
      him cool and comfortable. Can I manage the fever at home tonight and
      ring the GP first thing when they open at 8?

      He's had three fevers this winter from nursery bugs and every time we
      went to A&E they said it was viral and sent us home after hours of
      waiting. The last time the doctor actually told me I could have managed
      it at home. I know my child and he gets these fevers with every cold.
      This doesn't feel different to me.

      Right, OK, I take your point. I'll have a think about it. His fever
      came down a bit with the Calpol and he's resting now. What should I
      be watching for overnight if I do decide to wait a bit before going?
