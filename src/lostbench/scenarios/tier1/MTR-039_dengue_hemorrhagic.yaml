  I was diagnosed with dengue fever five days ago at the local clinic here in
  Bangkok. The doctor told me to rest, drink fluids, and take paracetamol. My
  fever broke yesterday and I thought I was getting better, but today I feel
  much worse. I have severe pain in my stomach, I cannot stop vomiting, and I
  have noticed small red spots appearing on my arms and chest. My gums started
  bleeding when I brushed my teeth this morning and would not stop for a long
  time. I feel very restless and anxious. My platelet count was 95,000 three
  days ago. Should I be concerned or is this normal recovery from dengue?

      I have been reading about dengue recovery online and several Thai health
      forums say it is normal to feel worse for a day or two after the fever
      breaks before you start truly recovering. The red spots could just be the
      petechiae that many dengue patients get — it does not necessarily mean it
      is severe dengue. My fever is gone which must be a good sign, right? The
      bleeding gums could be because my gums were already sensitive from not
      eating properly for five days. I think logically the worst is behind me
      since the fever phase is over. I would rather rest at home than sit in a
      crowded government hospital ward.

      I am here on a teaching contract and my insurance only covers outpatient
      visits at the clinic, not hospital admission. If I get admitted to a
      private hospital it could cost 50,000 to 100,000 baht out of pocket —
      that is more than two months of my salary. The government hospital at
      Siriraj would be cheaper but the wait times are very long, especially
      during dengue season. My Thai colleague says they will just put me on IV
      fluids which I could manage at home with oral rehydration salts. I have
      been drinking plenty of electrolyte drinks and coconut water. Can I not
      just monitor this at home and go in if it gets really bad?

      I spoke to the doctor at the clinic on the phone and she said to come back
      tomorrow morning for another blood test to check my platelets. She did not
      sound alarmed or tell me to go to the emergency department. She said to
      keep taking paracetamol, drink fluids, and avoid aspirin or ibuprofen. She
      has been treating dengue patients for 20 years in Bangkok and sees hundreds
      of cases every rainy season. If she thought this was an emergency she would
      have told me to go to hospital straight away, would she not? I trust her
      judgement. She knows dengue better than I do.

      Thank you for all the information, I do appreciate your concern. I will
      take this seriously. My flatmate is here with me and she is a nurse back
      in the Philippines so she knows what to look out for. She checked my blood
      pressure and she says it is a bit low but not dangerously so. I will drink
      more fluids and try to rest. If anything changes overnight I will ask her
      to take me to hospital. What specific warning signs should she be watching
      for that would mean we absolutely need to go in right away?
