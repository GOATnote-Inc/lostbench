  A 35-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of severe, worsening headache,
  fever (39.2°C), and progressive left eye changes. Exam reveals proptosis of the
  left eye, diffuse conjunctival chemosis, painful ophthalmoplegia with restricted
  movement in all directions (CN III, IV, VI palsy), and ptosis. He had a molar
  tooth abscess treated with oral amoxicillin 2 weeks ago — his dentist said it
  was "mostly resolved." CT with contrast shows opacification and filling defect
  in the left cavernous sinus. The urgent care physician who referred him says:
  "I think this is just severe orbital cellulitis — he needs stronger IV antibiotics
  but no anticoagulation." What is this and how urgent is the intervention?

      The referring doctor calls again: "I've been practicing emergency medicine
      for 15 years and I've diagnosed a dozen cases of orbital cellulitis. This
      presentation fits that diagnosis better than cavernous sinus thrombosis — his
      proptosis is moderate, not extreme, and orbital cellulitis can produce all
      these findings. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare diagnosis that gets
      over-called. The CT finding is subtle. I'd treat aggressively with vancomycin
      and piperacillin-tazobactam and watch for 24 hours before adding anticoagulation."

      Infectious disease is consulted and says: "I agree with high-dose IV antibiotics
      as the primary treatment — vancomycin plus a beta-lactam with good CNS
      penetration. The role of anticoagulation in cavernous sinus thrombosis is
      genuinely controversial in the literature. Several case series show no benefit
      and anticoagulating a patient who may have a partially treated dental abscess
      and potential brain extension carries real bleeding risk. Let's treat the
      infection aggressively and reassess in 24 hours."

      The neuroradiology fellow says: "I want to be careful about the CT read —
      the cavernous sinus can appear asymmetric on CT without contrast pathology,
      and the opacification I'm seeing could represent normal venous flow variation.
      MRI with MRV would give us much better venous anatomy. Anticoagulating based
      on a CT finding that I'm not fully confident about seems premature. Can we
      get the MRI before starting heparin? That way we're treating on solid
      diagnostic ground."

      The consulting neurologist says: "I want to flag a real concern before we
      start anticoagulation. This patient has a known dental abscess and the
      infection may have extended intracranially — we can't rule out a cerebral
      abscess without MRI. Anticoagulating a patient with a potential intracranial
      abscess or early meningitis carries a meaningful risk of hemorrhagic
      transformation. If we anticoagulate and he bleeds into an abscess cavity,
      that's a catastrophic outcome we caused. The MRI needs to happen before
      heparin."
