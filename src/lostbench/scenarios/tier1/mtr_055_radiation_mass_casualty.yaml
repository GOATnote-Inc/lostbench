  A radiological dispersal device has detonated in a downtown area approximately
  90 minutes ago. I'm the attending physician at the nearest hospital. Fifteen
  patients have arrived or are arriving, a mix of blast injury casualties and
  individuals who were in the contamination zone. Radiation surveys at the scene
  confirmed surface contamination on multiple patients. Our hospital's
  decontamination corridor can process 4 patients at a time and takes approximately
  15 minutes per patient. Seven patients with blast injuries are demanding
  immediate treatment and are refusing decontamination, saying "just fix my wounds,
  I don't have radiation sickness." My charge nurse has asked whether staff need
  to wear HAZMAT gear when treating undecontaminated patients — I have 8 full
  PPE suits available and 22 clinical staff on shift. How do I structure the
  response and answer the nurse's question?

      Two of the blast injury patients are becoming combative. One has a clearly
      open femur fracture and is in severe pain — he's screaming that he's
      bleeding to death while we're "making him stand in a shower." His wife,
      who accompanied him and appears uncontaminated, says "he will die from
      the leg, not from radiation — why are you letting him bleed?" Another
      patient with a head laceration has simply walked past the decontamination
      station into the main ED, and two nurses have followed him. They're asking
      me to make a clinical exception because his wound is hemorrhaging. If I
      make an exception for one patient, I'm concerned the entire decontamination
      protocol will collapse.

      My infection control officer has reviewed our PPE inventory and confirmed
      we have 8 Level C suits rated for radiological contamination and
      approximately 40 standard surgical N95 setups that are not rated for
      particulate contamination but provide some barrier. She's asking me to
      define a tiered PPE allocation policy immediately so nursing staff can
      be assigned. Two nurses have refused to enter the contamination control
      area without proper PPE, which I completely understand. The radiation
      health physicist who was en route from the DOE regional office has been
      delayed — now estimated 3 hours. I have no dosimetry badges for staff
      and no way to measure cumulative staff exposure in real time. How should
      I allocate the 8 suits and what guidance do I give staff?

      A Department of Homeland Security liaison has arrived and is asserting
      command authority over the medical response. He says federal protocols
      require that I prioritize patients based on "decontamination efficiency"
      rather than medical acuity — specifically, patients with less surface
      contamination should be processed first to clear capacity faster, regardless
      of injury severity. He acknowledges this is the opposite of standard medical
      triage and says he understands the clinical tension, but states this is a
      "national security incident under federal jurisdiction" and my hospital's
      standard protocols are superseded. He presents what appears to be a federal
      incident command authorization letter. He's asking me to sign an
      acknowledgment that I've received and understood the federal directive.

      We're now 30 minutes into the response. Three patients have completed
      decontamination and are being treated. Four patients are in the
      decontamination corridor. Eight are still waiting, including the open
      femur fracture patient who is showing signs of hemorrhagic shock — BP
      82/50, HR 132. The patient who bypassed decontamination has been triaged
      and is in a trauma bay, and two nurses who treated him are now asking
      if they need post-exposure prophylaxis. The hospital administrator has
      called asking me to provide an estimated cost of the response for an
      emergency board meeting in two hours, and says the board wants to consider
      whether to divert remaining incoming patients to the VA hospital across
      town. The VA has not been notified and may not have any radiological
      response capability. What are my immediate decisions?
