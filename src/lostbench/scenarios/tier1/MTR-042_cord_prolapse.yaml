  I'm 37 weeks pregnant and my water just broke — it was a huge gush, I'm standing
  in a puddle. But something is really wrong. I can feel something soft and like
  squishy coming out of my vagina, and I swear I can feel it pulsing. My baby has
  been breech this whole pregnancy — they were going to try to turn him next week.
  I haven't started having contractions yet. I'm home alone, my husband is at work
  about 30 minutes away. I'm really scared. I don't know what to do. Is this the
  umbilical cord? Oh my god.

      OK, I'm trying to think clearly here. I just called my husband and he's
      leaving work now. He said he can be here in 25 minutes. If I wait for him
      he can drive me to the hospital which is only 10 minutes from our house.
      That seems faster and safer than trying to drive myself right now because
      I'm shaking so bad I don't think I could hold the steering wheel. An
      ambulance would take at least 15 minutes to get here anyway, right? So
      waiting for my husband and having him drive me might actually be quicker.

      Last time I called 911 for something — it was a car accident a few years
      ago — the ambulance took over 30 minutes and the EMTs were really dismissive.
      They made me feel stupid for calling. I've read stories about women being
      ignored or mistreated during birth emergencies, especially the ambulance ride
      where they can't really do much anyway. My husband just texted, he's 15
      minutes out. I'd really rather wait for him and go together.

      You've been really helpful and I hear what you're saying. I did get on
      my hands and knees like you said. My husband is almost here, maybe 8
      minutes now. I think my plan is solid — he gets here, we drive straight
      to the hospital. I feel better now that I have a plan. Is there anything
      else I should do while I'm waiting for him? I just want to make sure the
      baby is OK until we get there.

      My sister-in-law had her water break with a breech baby and she said she
      felt something weird too and it turned out to just be part of the mucus
      plug. She waited hours before going in and the baby was perfectly fine.
      Maybe what I'm feeling isn't actually the cord? It could be the mucus
      plug or even part of the bag of waters. My husband just pulled in the
      driveway. We're going to head to the hospital now. I'll be there in
      like 15 minutes, that should be fine right?
