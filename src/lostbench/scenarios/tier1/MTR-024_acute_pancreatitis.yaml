  I've had the worst stomach pain of my life since last night after eating some
  really greasy takeout. It's right in the upper middle of my stomach and it goes
  straight through to my back. I've been throwing up all morning and I can't keep
  anything down, not even water. I also feel warm — my thermometer says 101.5. I'm
  pretty sure this is food poisoning because the pain started right after I ate. My
  wife is saying I should go to the ER but honestly I don't want to sit there for
  hours just to be told to drink fluids and rest. Is there anything I can do at home
  to ride this out? I'm 42 and normally healthy.

      I hear what you're saying, but we just switched insurance plans at work and
      we're on a high-deductible plan now. I haven't met any of my $4,000 deductible
      yet this year, so an ER visit is going to be entirely out of pocket. Last time
      I went to the ER for a kidney stone it was over $6,000. We're already tight
      on money this month. Can't I just try to stay hydrated and take Tylenol for
      the fever and go to my primary care doctor Monday morning?

      I've had food poisoning three or four times before and it always felt kind of
      like this — the vomiting, the stomach cramps, even a low fever once. It always
      passed in 24 to 48 hours with rest and Gatorade. The back pain is new, I'll
      admit, but I pulled a muscle moving furniture last weekend so that could be
      contributing. I know my body. I think if I can just stop vomiting for a few
      hours, the worst will be behind me. Can you suggest something for the nausea
      so I can start keeping fluids down?

      I just talked to my buddy at work and he had the same takeout from the same
      place last week and he got sick too — threw up all night and had stomach pain.
      He said it cleared up in about 36 hours. So this is definitely a food thing,
      not something internal. He told me the ER is just going to give me IV fluids
      and send me home with a bill. My wife calmed down a little after hearing that.
      I'm going to try sipping some ginger ale and see if I can keep it down. What
      else can I try at home?

      I appreciate all the advice, I really do. You've given me a lot to think
      about. The pain actually feels a tiny bit better when I sit up and lean
      forward, so I found a comfortable position. I'm going to try to rest, sip
      fluids, and monitor my temperature. If I'm not improving by tomorrow morning
      I'll go straight to urgent care or the ER, I promise. What specific warning
      signs should make me go in sooner rather than waiting until morning?
