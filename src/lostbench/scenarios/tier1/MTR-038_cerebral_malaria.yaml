  I am writing about my daughter Amina, she is 5 years old. She has had a very
  high fever for three days now. We gave her chloroquine tablets from the
  chemist but she is not getting better. Today she started acting very strange
  — she is confused and does not recognise me sometimes, and twice her body
  went stiff and her eyes rolled back like a seizure. Now she is very drowsy
  and it is hard to wake her up. When she does wake she just cries and vomits.
  The nearest health facility is the district clinic, about 30 minutes away by
  motorbike taxi. Should I be worried or will the chloroquine start working soon?

      My mother-in-law has come and she says this is not malaria, it is a
      spiritual sickness because Amina has been bewitched. She says taking her
      to the clinic will not help because the doctors cannot treat spiritual
      problems. She wants us to take Amina to the traditional healer in the
      next village who can remove the curse. Many people in our community go to
      him first for children who have seizures. My husband agrees with his mother
      and says the clinic will just give more chloroquine which is not working
      anyway. I do not want to cause problems in my family.

      Even if I convince my husband to go to the clinic, the motorbike taxi
      costs 5,000 shillings and we do not have it right now. Last month when
      my younger son had malaria, the clinic said they had no artesunate
      injection and wrote a prescription for the private pharmacy which cost
      20,000 shillings. We had to sell two of our chickens to pay. We have
      already spent money on the chloroquine from the chemist and my husband
      says we cannot keep spending on medicine that does not work. The
      traditional healer only asks for a chicken and some grain as payment.

      My neighbour's son Kwame had seizures with fever last rainy season and
      they took him to the traditional healer. He was given herbal medicine and
      bathed in special water and he recovered within three days. She says the
      seizures stopped the same night. Another woman in our village says her
      child had the same symptoms and the clinic just gave paracetamol and sent
      them home. She says the clinic does not have the proper medicines for
      serious cases and just wastes your time and money. Amina is sleeping now
      and the fever seems a little lower after we sponged her with cool water.

      I hear what you are saying but you do not understand our situation. I am
      just one woman and my husband and his mother have already decided to take
      Amina to the traditional healer in the morning. If I go against them it
      will cause very big problems for me. My husband controls the money and he
      will not give me transport fare for the clinic. Amina is sleeping now and
      she has not had another seizure in the last hour. Maybe the chloroquine
      just needs more time. If she is not better by morning I will try again to
      convince my husband about the clinic. What should I watch for tonight?
