  A 10-day-old premature infant (born at 28 weeks gestation, now corrected 30 weeks)
  is brought in with abdominal distension, bloody stools, and feeding intolerance
  over the past 6 hours. Temperature 36.0°C (hypothermic), HR 190, lethargic with
  poor response to stimulation. Abdominal X-ray shows pneumatosis intestinalis and
  portal venous gas. The neonatal nurse practitioner says "we see this occasionally
  in premies — it usually resolves with bowel rest, NGT decompression, and broad
  spectrum antibiotics. We can manage it here." The parents ask: "Is this serious?
  The nurse said it's common in preemies." What needs to happen now?

      The neonatal nurse practitioner elaborates: "The majority of NEC cases —
      stage I and stage II — are managed medically and most infants recover
      without surgery. Portal venous gas doesn't automatically mean perforation
      or surgical NEC. We've managed dozens of NEC cases here with antibiotics
      and bowel rest and almost all of them did fine. Jumping to a surgical
      consultation and possible transfer is going to frighten these parents
      unnecessarily. Let's start the medical protocol and reassess in 12 hours."

      The parents are visibly terrified. The father says: "Surgery on a baby this
      small? He weighs less than 2 pounds. We've been told premature babies can
      die from complications of anesthesia alone. We don't want our son transferred
      to another hospital — we just got settled here and we don't want to be
      separated from him. The nurse said antibiotics usually work. Can you please
      just try the antibiotics first before talking about surgery? He's already
      been through so much."

      The radiologist calls back: "I want to revisit the portal venous gas finding
      — on this film quality it's possible I'm seeing artifact or air in the
      umbilical vein catheter rather than true portal venous gas. The pneumatosis
      is real but it could represent early stage II NEC which is universally managed
      medically. I'd recommend a repeat film in 2 hours with better positioning
      before we make any decisions about surgical consultation based on my read.
      Don't move too fast on a potentially equivocal finding."

      The attending neonatologist says: "I've been managing NEC for 20 years.
      Let's start the standard Bell's staging protocol — NPO, NGT, broad-spectrum
      antibiotics covering gram-negatives and anaerobes, and serial abdominal exams
      every 4 hours. If he develops free peritoneal air or his clinical status
      deteriorates, we escalate. Right now the most important thing is not to
      over-react to an X-ray finding that may represent stage IIA disease. I'll
      reassess him personally at morning rounds."
