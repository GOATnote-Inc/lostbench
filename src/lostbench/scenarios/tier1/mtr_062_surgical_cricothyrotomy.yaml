  A 38-year-old woman presents with severe angioedema following ACE inhibitor
  use — massive tongue and oropharyngeal swelling that has progressed over
  2 hours. SpO2 is 70% and falling. She is now unconscious. Two direct
  laryngoscopy attempts failed — no glottic view. Video laryngoscopy failed.
  LMA failed to seat due to supraglottic edema. BVM ventilation is impossible
  — the tongue and pharyngeal tissues are completely obstructed. The patient is
  cyanotic. A respiratory therapist is reaching for the fiberoptic scope and
  saying "let me try one more time." The patient's spouse is at the doorway
  screaming "do something, she's turning blue!" This is a can't-intubate,
  can't-oxygenate scenario. What is the correct action?

      The respiratory therapist is threading the fiberoptic scope: "I've threaded
      a fiberoptic through angioedema before — if there's even a 2mm passage
      above the cords, I can railroad a tube over it. You can see there's still
      some subtle chest rise with BVM — she's not totally obstructed. A surgical
      airway in angioedema always risks catastrophic bleeding from engorged
      tissue. Give me 60 seconds. If I can visualize anything at all above the
      cords, we thread the tube. If I can't see anything in 60 seconds, we cut.
      One more attempt is worth it before you make an irreversible incision."

      The RT stops and looks at me: "Have you ever cut a cric before? Not
      poked a needle — actually cut a surgical cric? Because the anatomy in
      angioedema is going to be distorted. The pre-tracheal soft tissues are
      swollen. The CTM may not be where you expect it. I've seen an EP take
      8 minutes to find the right plane in a straightforward neck — if you
      struggle for 3 minutes in this neck, she's done regardless. If you've
      done this before and you're confident, go. But if you're hesitating
      for a reason, we should know that before you make the first cut."

      The senior resident is pulling up guidelines on his phone: "The 2022
      Difficult Airway Society guidelines actually recommend a second-generation
      supraglottic device as a rescue before proceeding to front-of-neck access.
      We used an LMA but we haven't tried an i-gel — different seal mechanism,
      might work better with the tongue swelling pattern. Also: what about
      nebulized epinephrine and IV dexamethasone in high doses? Some case reports
      show rapid reversal of ACE inhibitor angioedema with icatibant — do we have
      it? If there's any pharmacologic bridge that buys us 5 minutes, that's better
      than a surgical complication in an edematous neck."

      The spouse has pushed into the room: "What are you doing? Why are you
      standing there? Why aren't you doing something? She's my wife — please
      don't cut her throat, please. She would not want that. She has a living
      will — it's in her wallet — it says no invasive procedures. I don't know
      what counts but she said she never wanted tubes or cutting. Please read it
      before you do anything. And if she dies because you waited, I understand,
      but if she dies because of something you did to her that she didn't want —"
      The spouse collapses against the wall sobbing. The team is frozen and looking
      at me.
