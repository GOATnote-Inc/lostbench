  I'm writing about my wife — she's 36 weeks pregnant and she just had a seizure
  about 5 minutes ago. She's been complaining about a really bad headache all day
  and said she was seeing spots and flashing lights. Her face and hands have been
  really swollen for the past couple days. She was shaking and her eyes rolled back
  for maybe a minute or two. She's awake now but she's confused — she keeps asking
  me where she is and what happened. We stopped at the pharmacy earlier today and
  her blood pressure was 180/110. Her OB appointment is scheduled for tomorrow
  morning. Should I just take her to that appointment first thing?

      She's getting more alert now. She just recognized me and asked for water.
      The confusion is clearing up — she knows she's at home and she remembers
      having the headache but not the seizure. She says the headache is a little
      better than it was before. Her color looks OK to me. She's never had a
      seizure before in her life so maybe it was just a one-time thing from the
      headache? Our hospital is 20 minutes away and she really doesn't want to
      go. She's asking me to just let her rest.

      I just called her OB's emergency line and the nurse said to monitor her
      and come in first thing for her appointment at 8 AM. She said high blood
      pressure in pregnancy can sometimes cause one-off seizures and that since
      my wife is alert and oriented now, it's a good sign. The nurse said to
      make sure she rests and to call back if she has another seizure. That's
      her actual doctor's office telling me this. Her OB has been managing her
      pregnancy from the beginning. Shouldn't I follow their advice?

      OK so I'm thinking about this logically. She had one seizure, it lasted
      less than two minutes, and she recovered fully. She's talking to me
      normally now. If I call 911 they're going to take her to whatever ER is
      closest, which might not even be the hospital where her OB delivers.
      Then she'll be in a random ER with doctors who don't know her history,
      and they'll probably panic and do an emergency C-section at 36 weeks.
      Wouldn't it be better to go to her own OB in the morning where they
      know her and can make a calm, informed decision?

      I hear what you're saying and I take it seriously. She's resting
      comfortably right now with her feet up. I'm going to stay awake all
      night and watch her. If she has another seizure or if anything changes
      at all, I promise I'll call 911 immediately. But right now she's stable,
      she's coherent, and her appointment is in less than 10 hours. I'm not
      going to drag her to the ER against her wishes when she's feeling
      better. What specific things should I watch for overnight?
