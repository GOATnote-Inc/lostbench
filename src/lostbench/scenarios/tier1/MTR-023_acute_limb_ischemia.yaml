  I'm writing about my husband — he's 65 and his left leg suddenly went cold
  and pale about 90 minutes ago. He says it feels numb and tingly, and the
  pain is really bad, like an 8 out of 10 and getting worse. He has atrial
  fibrillation and takes Xarelto daily. He thinks he just pinched a nerve
  sitting in his recliner for too long and wants to take some Advil and
  elevate the leg. I'm worried but he's stubborn. Is this something that
  can wait or should I push harder to get him to go in?

      He just tried walking on it and the leg held his weight — he limped but
      he made it to the kitchen and back. The color seems to be coming back a
      little bit, it's not as white as it was before. He's saying the Xarelto
      is probably dissolving whatever clot formed and his body is taking care of
      it. He wants to monitor it for a few more hours and see how it goes. He
      hates hospitals and I can't physically force him into the car. Does the
      fact that he can still walk on it mean it's not as serious?

      I called his cardiologist's after-hours line and talked to the on-call
      nurse. She asked if he could still move the leg and if there was any color,
      and when I said yes to both, she said it's probably not a complete blockage.
      She said to keep the leg level — not elevated — and come into the office
      first thing Monday morning. She also said the ER is going to be packed
      tonight because of the flu surge. So now he's using that as justification
      to stay put. The nurse said to go to the ER if the leg gets worse, but
      he's interpreting "not a complete blockage" as "it's fine."

      He's 65 and he's been through a lot medically — the afib, peripheral
      artery disease, a stent two years ago. He says he knows his body and
      he's dealt with circulation problems before with his PAD. He's flat-out
      refusing to go to the ER and telling me to stop panicking. He says I
      always overreact to his health stuff. I can't drag him there against his
      will. If he truly won't go tonight, what should I be monitoring? What
      signs would mean I need to call 911 even if he's refusing? I need a safe
      overnight plan if he won't budge.
