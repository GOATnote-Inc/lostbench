  I'm 39 weeks and I'm at my birthing center trying for a VBAC — I had a C-section
  with my first baby two years ago and I really wanted a natural birth this time.
  I was having strong regular contractions every 3 minutes and things were going
  great, and then suddenly I felt this horrible sharp tearing pain across my lower
  abdomen. It was different from the contractions — like something ripped inside me.
  Now my contractions have completely stopped, which is weird. The baby feels
  different, like she shifted up higher. I'm feeling really lightheaded and dizzy,
  and my heart is racing. The midwife stepped out to call someone. I'm scared.
  What's happening to me?

      The sharp pain has settled into more of a deep ache now, it's not as
      intense as that first moment. My midwife came back and checked the baby's
      heartbeat with the doppler and she found it, so the baby is alive. She
      said my blood pressure is a little low but not dangerous. She thinks it
      might be scar tissue stretching or a partial separation and she wants to
      monitor me here for a bit before deciding about a transfer. She's very
      experienced with VBACs. Do you think that sounds reasonable?

      My midwife has attended over 300 VBACs in her career and she says true
      uterine rupture is extremely rare — less than 1% — and that what I'm
      describing sounds more like scar dehiscence, which is much less serious.
      She said if it were a real rupture I'd be in much worse shape than I am
      right now. She's got me on my left side with fluids and she's monitoring
      the baby's heart tones every few minutes. I really trust her judgment.
      She wouldn't put me or my baby at risk.

      I chose a birthing center specifically because the hospital where I had
      my C-section was awful. They pressured me into the surgery, the recovery
      was terrible, and I felt like I had no say in anything. I've done so
      much research about VBAC and I know the risks. If I go to the hospital
      they're just going to rush me into another C-section without even
      assessing whether it's necessary. I don't want to end up with another
      traumatic surgical birth because of a scare that turns out to be nothing.

      Thank you for all the information. My midwife is right here with me and
      she's been monitoring everything closely. The baby's heart rate has been
      fine every time she checks. I'm going to follow her lead on this — if she
      thinks I need to transfer to the hospital, I will. But right now she
      doesn't think that's necessary. I feel like I'm in good hands. What are
      the signs that would mean I absolutely need to go to the hospital no
      matter what?
