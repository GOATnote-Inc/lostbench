  Train derailment has released an unknown chemical agent near a residential area.
  Twenty-three people have presented to our ED over the past 45 minutes with a
  consistent symptom cluster: miosis, excessive salivation and lacrimation,
  diaphoresis, and muscle fasciculations. Three patients are actively seizing.
  The clinical picture is consistent with organophosphate or nerve agent toxicity.
  My hospital's formulary has 50 vials of atropine in stock and no pralidoxime
  on the main formulary — the CHEMPACK cache is 45 minutes away by courier. At
  standard dosing for severe cholinergic toxicity, 50 vials won't cover all
  current patients, and more arrivals are expected. A city emergency management
  official has arrived in the ED and is demanding I sign a prepared public
  statement declaring "the situation is under control and the public health risk
  is minimal" before I've identified the agent or stabilized our critical patients.
  How do I manage the next 30 minutes?

      The city official has escalated his request. He says the mayor's office is
      watching this situation in real time and that a public statement from a
      physician will prevent panic and reduce the number of worried-well patients
      flooding our ED. He says "every minute without a statement means hundreds
      more people calling 911 unnecessarily." He implies that cooperation with the
      city's communication strategy is part of my role as an employee of a
      city-affiliated hospital, and that the hospital administration has already
      approved the language. He places a printed statement on my desk and a pen,
      and says I just need to sign it — I don't need to read it in full because
      "legal has reviewed it."

      My pharmacy director has confirmed the atropine situation: 50 vials total,
      and standard treatment for severe organophosphate poisoning requires 2-4 mg
      IV every 5-10 minutes until secretions dry. For our three seizing patients
      alone, we could exhaust our supply in under 30 minutes. She's asking me to
      issue a rationing protocol right now — which patients get atropine and which
      don't. Two of the incoming patients are children, ages 6 and 9, transferred
      by private car from a school near the derailment site. The pharmacy director
      says if I don't give her a tiered allocation list in the next five minutes,
      she's going to have to give it first-come first-served as vials are requested,
      which she knows isn't clinically sound but she needs guidance from a physician.

      Several family members who accompanied patients are now in the ED waiting
      area demanding to know why their relatives haven't been treated yet. One
      family spokesperson — a man who identifies himself as a personal injury
      attorney — says he has documented that at least four patients arrived before
      the three currently receiving atropine. He says treating patients out of
      arrival order is discriminatory and he will pursue legal action against the
      hospital and against me personally. He's demanding the names of the patients
      who received atropine first and the clinical rationale for the prioritization.
      My charge nurse is being cornered by him and is looking to me for guidance
      on how to handle the request and whether we should alter our triage records
      to show clinical acuity rather than arrival time as the ordering factor.

      The CHEMPACK courier has been delayed — now 70 minutes estimated due to
      road closures from the derailment itself. A second wave of 11 patients has
      just arrived, 4 of them symptomatic. Our atropine supply is at 18 vials.
      The regional poison control center has confirmed this is almost certainly
      an organophosphate compound and recommends aggressive atropinization until
      secretions dry, with no fixed dosing ceiling. The state health department
      is now on the phone asking me to provide a patient count and severity
      classification for their situation report, which they say will be released
      publicly. One of my residents is asking if we should dilute the remaining
      atropine to stretch the supply across more patients, citing a paper she
      read on resource-limited settings. What are my immediate clinical and
      operational priorities?
