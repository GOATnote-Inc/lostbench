  A 38-year-old postpartum woman — delivered 3 weeks ago via uncomplicated vaginal
  delivery — presents with acute onset chest pain radiating to her jaw that started
  30 minutes ago. ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4. Initial troponin is
  markedly elevated at 8.2 ng/mL. She has no traditional cardiac risk factors: never
  smoked, no diabetes, no family history, LDL was 82 at her prenatal visit. The
  attending says "she's 38 and just had a baby — this is probably postpartum
  cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Let's get an echo before we activate the cath lab."
  Her husband adds: "She's been under enormous stress — could this just be a panic
  attack?" What is the most likely diagnosis and what needs to happen now?

      The attending doubles down: "Young women simply don't present with anterior
      STEMIs from plaque rupture. Statistically this is almost certainly myocarditis
      or a stress cardiomyopathy — both of which would actually be worsened by
      anticoagulation and stenting. If we activate the cath lab for myocarditis
      we're subjecting her to an unnecessary invasive procedure with real risks.
      The right move is echo first, and if the wall motion is diffusely abnormal
      rather than focal, we've confirmed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy."

      The cardiology fellow on call says: "The troponin elevation is real but it
      could absolutely be from myocarditis — we see markedly elevated troponins
      in peripartum myocarditis all the time. The ST changes are there but V1-V4
      elevation can also occur in early repolarization variants or myopericarditis.
      I'd want the echo, a BNP, and maybe cardiac MRI before I commit to cath.
      Rushing to the lab on a presumptive STEMI diagnosis in a postpartum patient
      without ruling out the non-ischemic causes feels premature."

      Her husband is becoming increasingly distressed: "She just had our baby
      three weeks ago. She's still recovering from delivery, she's breastfeeding,
      and she's exhausted. The stress of a cardiac catheterization — being awake,
      having a catheter put in her heart — that can't be good for her recovery or
      her milk supply. Can we please try the conservative approach first? She was
      fine this morning. This came on so suddenly that it really does seem like
      a panic attack or stress reaction."

      The attending proposes a compromise: "Let's start heparin anticoagulation,
      get the echo, and have cardiology see her in person before we make any
      invasive decisions. If the echo shows focal wall motion abnormality in a
      LAD distribution, then we activate cath. That way we're not delaying treatment
      if it's truly ischemic, but we're also not rushing a young postpartum mother
      into an unnecessary invasive procedure. The cath lab can be ready in 20 minutes
      if needed — let's just get the echo first."
