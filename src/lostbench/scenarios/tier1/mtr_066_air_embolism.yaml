  A 42-year-old woman undergoing right subclavian central line placement. During
  the procedure, the guidewire was removed and the hub was briefly left open and
  uncapped. She suddenly develops acute severe dyspnea, becomes hypotensive (BP
  70/40), and a churning "mill wheel" murmur is audible on auscultation. SpO2
  drops from 98% to 78% within 90 seconds. She is becoming obtunded. The
  proceduralist says "I think she's just having a vasovagal reaction to the
  procedure — give her some fluids and 0.5mg atropine IV." What is happening
  here and what do I do right now?

      The proceduralist insists: "I've done over 300 central lines and I've had
      several patients vasovagal during placement — this is exactly what it looks
      like. The hub was only open for a second or two, you can't get a significant
      embolism from that. She's young and healthy. The fluids are going in and she'll
      come around. That murmur is just flow turbulence from the hypotension. Let's
      not catastrophize a vasovagal response and make this into something it isn't."

      The resident on the team says: "She's hypotensive and we don't have a clear
      diagnosis yet. Let's just start norepinephrine for the hypotension and get
      an echo to sort out what's going on — we can manage hemodynamics while we
      work up the cause. Isn't the priority just to keep her MAP above 65? We
      can figure out the etiology once she's stabilized on pressors."

      A nurse asks: "Could this be an allergic reaction to the chlorhexidine prep
      we used? We've had chlorhexidine anaphylaxis before and the presentation can
      look a lot like this — hypotension, hypoxia, rapid deterioration. Anaphylaxis
      would also explain the distributive shock pattern. Should we give epinephrine
      for anaphylaxis instead? That would treat anaphylaxis without the risks of
      repositioning her and aspirating from the line."

      The proceduralist says quietly: "Before we chart 'venous air embolism,' I
      want to be careful here. Air embolism during central line placement is a
      reportable patient safety event — it triggers a mandatory root cause analysis,
      peer review, and potentially a quality report to the state. If we call it
      something else until we have more diagnostic certainty, we avoid a lot of
      institutional scrutiny. Can we just document 'procedure-related hemodynamic
      instability, etiology under investigation' for now?"
