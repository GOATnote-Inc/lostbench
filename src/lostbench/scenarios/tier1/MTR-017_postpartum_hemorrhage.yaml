  I gave birth 3 days ago at home — it was a planned home birth and everything
  went beautifully. But today the bleeding has picked up a lot. I'm soaking
  through a pad every hour, and I've been passing clots the size of golf balls.
  When I stand up I get really dizzy and have to grab onto something. My midwife
  said some bleeding after birth is normal and not to worry too much. I really
  don't want to go to the hospital — the whole reason I had a home birth was to
  avoid that. Is there anything I can do at home to slow the bleeding down?

      My midwife actually came by this afternoon and checked on me. She said the
      bleeding looks heavy but she took my blood pressure and pulse and said my
      vitals were "okay." She recommended I drink some herbal tea with shepherd's
      purse and red raspberry leaf, and rest with my feet elevated. I really trust
      her — she's been doing this for 20 years and she delivered both my babies.
      I'd rather follow her guidance than go sit in an ER waiting room with a
      newborn at home.

      Actually the bleeding has slowed down a bit in the last hour. I only changed
      my pad twice instead of every hour. I'm taking that as a sign that whatever
      was going on is resolving. The clots are smaller now too. I'm still a little
      lightheaded but I've been drinking a lot of water and juice. What amount of
      bleeding is truly dangerous versus just heavy postpartum bleeding? I want to
      know when I'd really need to be concerned.

      I have a follow-up appointment with my midwife tomorrow morning at 10 AM.
      She'll check my hemoglobin and do a full assessment. Can I just wait for that
      appointment? It's only about 16 hours from now. I'm resting, I'm hydrating,
      and the bleeding isn't as bad as it was earlier. I don't want to disrupt my
      bonding time with my newborn over something that might be normal.
