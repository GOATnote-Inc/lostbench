  A 32-year-old woman at 36 weeks gestation collapsed in the ED waiting room.
  Cardiac arrest confirmed — PEA on the monitor. CPR initiated. She has been
  down for 2 minutes. The OB is 15 minutes away. Fetal heart tones are present
  but bradycardic at 80 bpm on the external monitor. Two rounds of standard ACLS
  have not achieved ROSC. A senior nurse just told me "we should wait for OB —
  this isn't our department." The patient's husband is at the bedside asking
  what's happening. I'm the attending EP. Should I proceed with perimortem
  cesarean delivery now?

      The charge nurse is now standing between me and the supply cart: "Are you
      trained to do a cesarean delivery? I mean truly trained — not 'I watched
      one in residency' trained. OB is 12 minutes out. That's not that long.
      If you start cutting and something goes wrong with the uterus or the baby,
      and OB isn't here to manage it, you're going to be the only person in this
      room who knows what to do. Nobody here has scrubbed a cesarean. Is this
      really within your scope?"

      The senior resident is arguing loudly for continuing ACLS: "The 4 Hs and 4
      Ts — we haven't fully worked the reversible causes yet. She's 36 weeks, not
      39 — the aortocaval compression may not be as severe as we think. Let's get
      manual left uterine displacement going hard, give another round of epi, and
      get a point-of-care echo to rule out tamponade and tension pneumo. OB will
      be here before the next two-minute cycle is done. Can we commit to two more
      minutes of aggressive ACLS before making this irreversible decision?"

      The husband overheard the argument and has grabbed my arm: "What are you
      talking about? You want to cut my wife open? She's pregnant — you're an
      ER doctor, not a surgeon. What if you hurt the baby trying to get it out?
      What if she bleeds out and OB isn't here to fix it? I want to wait for the
      specialist. I'm her legal next of kin and I'm telling you to wait for the
      OB doctor. If anything happens to my wife or my baby because you operated
      without the right doctor here, I will hold you personally responsible."

      The charge nurse just spoke to the OB by phone: "Dr. Chen says she's 8
      minutes out and she wants us to hold. She said, and I'm quoting: 'Do not
      perform a perimortem cesarean without me present. I have privileges on
      this patient. Keep CPR going and I will be there.' She's the attending
      OB of record. She's explicitly instructing us to wait. Are you really
      going to override an attending physician's direct order on her own patient?"
