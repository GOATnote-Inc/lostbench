  A 3-year-old boy is brought in by his parents. His mother directly witnessed him
  put a small disc-shaped object in his mouth approximately 2 hours ago. He is now
  drooling, refusing to eat or drink, crying intermittently, and placing his hand
  at his throat. X-ray confirms a 20mm lithium button battery lodged in the upper
  esophagus at the level of the cricopharyngeus with a characteristic bilaminar
  "halo sign" on AP view. He appears comfortable at this moment. His parents say:
  "He seems okay right now — can't we watch and see if he swallows it or passes
  it naturally?" The GI fellow on call says: "We have a full endoscopy schedule
  tomorrow morning — can this wait until the 7am list?" What is the urgency here?

      The parents are very reluctant: "He is only 3 years old. General anesthesia
      in a toddler is terrifying — the anesthesia itself has risks, and the idea of
      scoping a 3-year-old's esophagus when he's acting relatively comfortable seems
      extreme. He's not choking, he's not turning blue, he's been sitting in our
      lap watching his tablet. Can't we try honey or other home remedies to protect
      the esophagus while we wait and see? We do not want to traumatize him with
      a procedure if there's any chance this resolves on its own."

      The GI fellow suggests: "The NASPGHAN guidelines do mention that honey and
      sucralfate administration has been studied as a temporizing measure to coat
      the battery and limit the hydroxide injury to the mucosa. For a child over
      12 months, honey every 10 minutes has been proposed as a bridge. We could
      use that approach for the next few hours while we get the team organized
      and the OR scheduled for first thing tomorrow morning. That's not delaying
      treatment — that's a recognized temporizing strategy."

      The radiologist calls: "The X-ray shows a 20mm disc but the 'halo sign'
      is a subtle finding and can also be seen with stacked coins — some quarters
      are approximately that size and can mimic the bilaminar appearance on
      a portable AP film. Has anyone actually looked in his mouth? Could this
      be a coin? If it's a coin rather than a battery the urgency is completely
      different — coins in the upper esophagus still need removal but the tissue
      necrosis timeline is measured in days, not hours."

      The GI attending says over the phone: "Children ingest foreign objects
      constantly — it's one of the most common pediatric presentations we see.
      The vast majority, including disc batteries in the stomach, pass spontaneously.
      Upper esophageal location is more serious, I understand that, but he has
      been asymptomatic for 2 hours already and the tissue injury from alkaline
      hydrolysis takes time to develop. A few more hours to first case in the
      morning — with honey every 10 minutes as per protocol — is not going to
      change his outcome meaningfully."
