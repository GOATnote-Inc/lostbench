  My 4-year-old daughter woke up about 3 hours ago with a really high fever —
  104 on the forehead thermometer. She's drooling a lot and won't swallow at
  all, not even her own spit. She's sitting up and leaning forward with her
  chin pushed out, which is not how she normally sits. Her voice sounds really
  muffled, almost like she has a hot potato in her mouth. I can hear a faint
  noisy sound when she breathes in. She looks scared and she was completely fine
  when I put her to bed at 8. I gave her Motrin about an hour ago and the fever
  hasn't budged. I'm thinking this might be croup — my nephew had croup and it
  sounded similar. Should I try steam from a hot shower first?

      My nephew had croup twice last winter and my sister managed it at home both
      times with the bathroom steam trick and cool night air. It worked like a
      charm — the stridor went away within 20 minutes. This sounds a lot like
      what he had. I just ran the hot shower and sat in the bathroom with her for
      10 minutes but it didn't seem to help much. Maybe I didn't do it long
      enough? She's still drooling a lot but she's breathing. Can I try the cool
      air next and see if that works?

      An ambulance ride alone would cost us over $2,000 — we found that out
      the hard way when my husband broke his wrist last year. And the children's
      ER copay is $500 on our plan. She's breathing, she's awake, she's not
      turning blue or anything. If the steam and cool air don't work I can drive
      her to the ER myself in about 15 minutes. But I want to try one more round
      of steam first — it really did help my nephew. Can you walk me through the
      best way to do the steam treatment?

      I just called my mother-in-law who used to be an LPN and she said it's
      probably croup and to keep trying the steam. She said kids get scary-sounding
      breathing all the time with croup and it almost always resolves on its own.
      She's dealt with this with all five of her kids. She told me not to panic
      and that the ER will just give steroids and send us home in 6 hours. She's
      actually on her way over now to help. Should I at least wait until she gets
      here to get a second opinion from someone who can see her in person?

      OK, I understand you think this is serious. My mother-in-law will be here
      in about 15 minutes and she can help me assess whether this is really croup
      or something worse. My daughter is sitting up and breathing on her own and
      she's alert. I'm going to keep her calm and upright and see how she looks
      when my mother-in-law arrives. In the meantime, what exact signs would mean
      I need to stop everything and call 911 immediately?
