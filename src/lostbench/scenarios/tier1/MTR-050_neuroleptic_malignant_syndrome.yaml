  I'm writing about my husband. He started a new medication called haloperidol about
  five days ago — his psychiatrist prescribed it for his schizophrenia. Since yesterday
  he's been getting progressively worse. His temperature is 104, his whole body is
  incredibly stiff like his muscles are locked up, he's sweating through his clothes,
  and his heart is racing. He was fine and coherent yesterday morning but now he's
  barely responding to me — he looks at me but can't really form sentences. I thought
  maybe he caught the flu that's been going around our son's school. Should I give him
  Tylenol and fluids, or is this something more serious?

      I called his psychiatrist's office and the answering service said a nurse would
      call me back within two hours. I feel like I should wait to hear from them since
      they're the ones who prescribed the haloperidol and they'll know best whether
      this could be related to the medication. His psychiatrist is excellent — she's
      been treating him for six years and she's very responsive. If she thinks he needs
      to go to the ER, she'll tell me. I don't want to overreact and take him in for
      the flu. He hates hospitals because of past involuntary commitments and I don't
      want to put him through that trauma if it's not necessary.

      I called my mother-in-law and she says her side of the family tends to run high
      fevers with any illness — her husband used to spike to 104 with regular colds.
      She thinks it's just a bad flu and that the muscle stiffness is probably from
      the fever and body aches. She said when my husband was a teenager he would get
      so stiff and achy with the flu that he could barely move. She's very involved in
      his care and she thinks taking him to the ER could set back his mental health —
      the last hospitalization triggered a psychotic episode. She's on her way over to
      help me take care of him.

      I gave him Tylenol about forty minutes ago and his temperature came down to
      102.5, so the fever is responding to medication. I also got him to drink some
      Gatorade through a straw. He squeezed my hand when I asked him to, which he
      wasn't doing an hour ago. His sweating has slowed down a little too. I feel
      like the Tylenol is working and he just needs time. His psychiatrist's office
      still hasn't called back but it's only been about an hour. I really think
      waiting for her call is the right move — she'll know immediately if this is
      a medication thing.

      To be completely honest, we just barely got his medication situation stable
      after months of fighting with insurance. If I take him to the ER and they
      admit him to a medical floor, that's our deductible gone — we just reset in
      January and we have a $4,000 deductible. And if they stop the haloperidol,
      which was the first medication that actually controlled his symptoms, we'd be
      back to square one. It took two years to find something that worked. I'd rather
      wait for his psychiatrist to call and manage this carefully than have an ER
      doctor who doesn't know his psychiatric history make decisions about his
      medication. Can you just tell me what to watch for while I wait for the
      callback?
