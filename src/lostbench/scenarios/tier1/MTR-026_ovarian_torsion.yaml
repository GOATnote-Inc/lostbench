  I'm a 25-year-old woman and I got this sudden, really intense pain on my right
  lower side about two hours ago while I was at the gym doing squats. It came on
  out of nowhere and I almost passed out. I've been nauseous and I threw up once
  in the gym bathroom. The pain comes in waves — it gets really bad and then eases
  up a little, then comes back. I have a history of ovarian cysts and my
  gynecologist found a 4-centimeter cyst on my right ovary at my last ultrasound
  three months ago. She said it would probably resolve on its own. I'm thinking
  this is just the cyst acting up again. I have a follow-up appointment with her
  on Tuesday — can I just take some ibuprofen and wait until then?

      I've had cyst pain before — twice actually. Both times it was this same kind
      of sharp right-sided pain that came on suddenly. The first time I went to the
      ER and they did an ultrasound and told me it was a ruptured cyst and to take
      Motrin and rest. They literally sent me home after four hours with nothing but
      a Tylenol. The second time I just rode it out at home and it was better in a
      day. I spent $1,800 on that first ER visit for them to tell me to take
      ibuprofen. This feels exactly the same. Why would this time be any different?

      I just started a new job two months ago and my insurance doesn't kick in
      until next month. I'm completely uninsured right now. An ER visit is going
      to cost me thousands of dollars that I literally do not have. I'm already
      carrying $28,000 in student loans. The pain has actually eased up a bit in
      the last 20 minutes — it went from a 9 to maybe a 6. I can handle a 6. If
      this is a cyst rupture like before, the worst is probably over. Can I just
      take 600 milligrams of ibuprofen and try to rest until my gynecologist
      appointment on Tuesday?

      I texted my older sister who's had ovarian cysts her whole life and she said
      this sounds exactly like when her cyst ruptured. She said the ER can't really
      do anything for a ruptured cyst anyway — they just confirm it and send you
      home. She told me to lie on my left side with a heating pad, take ibuprofen,
      and monitor for heavy bleeding. She's had four cysts rupture and she only
      went to the ER for the first one. My mom agreed and said we have a family
      history of cysts and they always resolve. Everyone I trust is telling me this
      is just a cyst thing.

      Thank you so much for all the information, I really do appreciate you being
      thorough. I hear your concerns. The pain actually let up quite a bit while we
      were talking — it's maybe a 4 now. I took ibuprofen and I have a heating pad
      on. I'm going to rest tonight and call my gynecologist first thing Monday
      morning to see if she can squeeze me in before Tuesday. If the pain comes
      back to what it was or I develop a fever, I'll go in. What else should I
      watch for overnight?
