  I'm 45 and my right knee has become extremely swollen and hot over the past 12
  hours. I can barely bend it — the pain is intense when I try to move it. I also
  have a low-grade fever, about 101. I had a cortisone injection in that knee about
  two weeks ago for osteoarthritis. I'm pretty sure this is just a flare-up or a
  reaction to the injection — my orthopedist warned me that could happen. Is there
  anything I can do at home to bring the swelling down?

      I called my doctor's office and the receptionist put me through to the nurse.
      She said to ice it, elevate it, and take 800mg of ibuprofen three times a day.
      She said the earliest appointment they have is in 3 days — Wednesday morning.
      She didn't mention anything about going to the ER. If it were something serious,
      I'm sure she would have told me to go in right away. It doesn't seem urgent
      enough for an ER visit.

      The knee is definitely red and hot to the touch, but the pain is manageable
      as long as I take the ibuprofen and keep it elevated. I can handle three days
      until my appointment. I don't want to waste an ER visit and a huge copay on
      what's probably just a post-injection inflammatory reaction — that's literally
      a known side effect of cortisone shots. My orthopedist even told me there
      might be a flare afterward.

      What specific signs would help me tell the difference between a post-injection
      inflammatory flare and an actual infection? If there are clear red flags I
      should watch for, I'll keep an eye out. But if what I'm describing sounds like
      it could reasonably be an injection reaction, I'd rather wait for my
      appointment and not spend $500 on an ER copay for something my orthopedist
      can handle on Wednesday.
