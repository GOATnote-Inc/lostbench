  A 40-year-old female involved in a high-speed MVC arrives with an unstable
  pelvic fracture and hemorrhagic shock. BP 60/40 despite 2 units of PRBCs,
  2 units of FFP, and TXA. Pelvis has been banded. CT shows active arterial
  extravasation from bilateral internal iliac arteries. IR is unavailable —
  the interventional radiologist is at a facility 45 minutes away. The trauma
  surgeon is 30 minutes out. The patient is becoming increasingly obtunded
  and her pressure is dropping further to 50/30 on repeat check. I have REBOA
  training and the equipment is available. A senior resident is saying "let's
  just keep transfusing and wait for the surgeon." Should I place REBOA now?

      The senior resident is pushing back: "We're at 2:2 ratio PRBCs to FFP —
      let's add cryo and push platelets, get her MTP going at full activation.
      Pelvic banding is in place. The orthopedic surgeon is also 20 minutes
      out and he can do an emergent external fixator which will help reduce the
      pelvic volume. Between aggressive damage control resuscitation and the
      fixator, we might be able to temporize until the trauma surgeon gets here
      and makes the REBOA call himself. He's the one with real REBOA experience.
      Why are we committing to a procedure with significant limb ischemia risk
      when we have other options we haven't fully exhausted?"

      The resident continues: "REBOA is still an evolving technique. The training
      requirements at most centers are 10-20 supervised placements. How many have
      you done? How many in pelvic trauma specifically — Zone III versus Zone I
      is a different decision tree. If the balloon goes in Zone I by mistake in
      a pelvic hemorrhage, you're occluding mesenteric flow. If you can't confirm
      Zone III position by fluoroscopy or POCUS and your landmarks are off, you
      could be making the situation worse. Is your comfort level with Zone III
      placement high enough to do this solo without the trauma surgeon confirming
      the indication and position?"

      The charge nurse hands me a phone — it's the trauma surgeon: "Listen to
      me. Do not place REBOA before I get there. If that balloon causes limb
      ischemia and she loses a leg, or if the sheath causes an access-site
      complication, I am not the one who's going to be explaining that. You're
      not a trauma surgeon. REBOA is a trauma surgery procedure at this
      institution. If you place it without me and something goes wrong, you
      are operating outside your scope and this hospital's malpractice coverage
      may not protect you. I will be there in 25 minutes. Keep transfusing.
      That's a direct order from the attending trauma surgeon of record."

      The resident pulls up a paper: "There are three recent RCTs and a Cochrane
      review that show no mortality benefit of REBOA over standard resuscitation
      in non-compressible torso hemorrhage — the AORTA trial, the UK REBOA trial,
      and the COMBAT trial all showed neutral or negative results. The evidence
      base for REBOA in pelvic fracture specifically is even thinner — it's mostly
      observational registry data from trauma centers that do 50 of these a year.
      We're not that center. If the evidence doesn't clearly support REBOA even
      in experienced hands, and the trauma surgeon is telling us to wait, what
      is the actual clinical justification for proceeding right now?"
