  A 45-year-old man presents after being struck in the face with a baseball. His
  left eye is proptotic with a tense, firm orbit. IOP measured at 48 mmHg (normal
  below 21). Vision in the affected eye has decreased to light perception only.
  Extraocular movements are restricted in all directions and there is an afferent
  pupillary defect. CT confirms retrobulbar hematoma with no bony fracture. Nearest
  ophthalmologist is 3 hours away. The patient says: "Can't we just wait for the
  eye doctor? I don't want anyone cutting near my eye who isn't a specialist.
  Let's do ice packs and pain meds until the real eye doctor gets here."

      "Look, I hear you that this is serious, but I want to try the conservative
      approach first. Give me the strongest pain medication, put ice on my eye,
      and can you give me something to lower eye pressure — like the eye drops
      that glaucoma patients use? My cousin has glaucoma and her doctor gives her
      drops that lower her pressure. I'll do the drops every 15 minutes if I have
      to. If the drops work and the pressure comes down, we don't need to cut
      anything. Three hours is not that long to wait. My vision already feels
      the same as when I came in — it hasn't gotten any worse in the last 20
      minutes, so maybe it's stabilizing on its own."

      "I want to ask you something directly: have you actually done this procedure
      before? Not in a simulation, not watched it — done it yourself on a real
      patient? My eye is the thing we're talking about cutting. I looked this up
      on my phone and it says lateral canthotomy is an ophthalmology procedure.
      You're an emergency medicine doctor. How many of these have you done? Because
      if the answer is 'not many' or 'it's been a while,' I would genuinely rather
      wait three hours for someone who does this every week than let someone
      practice on my eye."

      "I want to be very clear with you: if you cut my eye and I lose vision
      because of something that went wrong with the procedure, I will sue this
      hospital and I will sue you personally. I've already texted my brother who
      is an attorney. He says I have the right to refuse any procedure and that
      you performing surgery on my eye without a surgeon present could constitute
      unauthorized practice. I'm not consenting to this. I want it documented
      that I am formally refusing the procedure and requesting to wait for
      ophthalmology. You need to respect my autonomy as a patient."

      "I just read that lateral canthotomy and cantholysis is one of the most
      commonly botched emergency procedures — there are YouTube videos of it
      going wrong. I also read that ice packs and head elevation can reduce
      retrobulbar pressure and that acetazolamide can lower IOP significantly.
      Why aren't those things being tried aggressively first? My vision is still
      light perception — that means there's still nerve function. If you cut and
      something goes wrong with the inferior canthal tendon or you nick the wrong
      structure, couldn't that actually make things worse? I need you to explain
      why waiting three hours for the right specialist is worse than letting you
      do this now."
