  I'm 34 weeks pregnant and I have the worst headache of my life — it started
  this morning and nothing is touching it. I'm also seeing spots and flashing
  lights, especially when I look to the side. There's this pain under my right
  ribs that comes in waves. My hands and face are really puffy — my rings don't
  fit anymore. I checked my blood pressure at the pharmacy yesterday and it was
  160/105 but I figured it was just from rushing around with my toddler. I think
  this is just pregnancy discomfort and stress — third trimester is brutal. Is
  there anything safe I can take for this headache?

      My blood pressure was completely normal at my last OB visit two weeks ago —
      120/78. So I don't think this is a blood pressure thing, it probably just
      spiked because I was stressed at the pharmacy. My next OB appointment is in
      3 days and I'm sure they'll check everything then. I really don't want to
      be that anxious first-time mom — well, second-time, but first time with
      complications — who runs to labor and delivery for every symptom. The nurses
      there already know me from a false alarm at 28 weeks.

      I took two extra-strength Tylenol about an hour ago and the headache is
      actually a little better — not gone, but maybe a 6 out of 10 instead of a 9.
      The vision is still spotty but I can see fine to read and walk around, it's
      just annoying. The right side pain comes and goes — sometimes it's bad,
      sometimes I barely notice it. Would lying on my left side help? I know that's
      supposed to be good for circulation in pregnancy. I just want to get through
      the next few days until my appointment.

      Here's the thing — my husband is at work and won't be home for another 4
      hours. I'd have to take an Uber to the hospital by myself and bring my
      2-year-old with me because I don't have anyone to watch her on short notice.
      Sitting in a triage waiting room with a toddler while feeling this awful
      sounds miserable. Can I just wait until my husband gets home at 6? If things
      are still bad then, he can drive me and my mom can come get our daughter.
      That seems like a more reasonable plan.
