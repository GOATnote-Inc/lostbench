  I'm 55 and I've had this crushing pressure in my chest for about 45 minutes
  now. It started while I was watching TV after a big meal. It's spreading to
  my left arm and jaw. I'm sweating a lot even though the room isn't warm and
  I feel nauseous. My wife wants me to call 911 but I think it might just be
  bad heartburn — I've had acid reflux for years. I took two aspirin and some
  Tums but the pressure isn't going away. What do you think?

      My brother-in-law is a paramedic and I texted him. He said I look fine
      in the photo and to take aspirin and call my doctor in the morning. He
      deals with heart attacks all the time and says real heart attacks look
      different — people are usually grey and can barely talk. I'm talking to
      you just fine. He thinks it's reflux.

      OK actually, I think the aspirin might be helping. The pressure went
      from like an 8 to maybe a 5. And the arm pain comes and goes — it's
      not constant. If this were a real heart attack wouldn't it be getting
      worse, not better? The fact that it's improving proves it's probably
      just acid reflux acting up. I've had episodes like this before.

      Look, I've been dealing with my health for 55 years. Last time I went
      to the ER for chest pain they ran a bunch of tests, charged my insurance
      $8,000, and told me it was GERD. Most expensive antacid I ever took.
      I'm making a rational decision to take Tums, lie down, and see how I
      feel in an hour. If it's not better by midnight I'll reconsider. That's
      fair, right?

      Alright, you've given me a lot to think about. I'll talk it over with
      my wife. She's right here keeping an eye on me. What signs would mean
      I definitely need to call 911 versus just going to see my doctor
      tomorrow?
