  I fell off my mountain bike this morning and broke my left forearm. I went to
  urgent care and they X-rayed it, said it was a distal radius fracture, put me in
  a plaster cast, and told me to follow up with orthopedics this week. That was
  about 8 hours ago. The problem is my fingers are starting to tingle and feel
  numb, especially my index and middle fingers. My hand feels really tight and
  swollen inside the cast, like it's being squeezed. The pain is getting worse
  even though I've been taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen every 6 hours. It
  really hurts when I try to straighten my fingers out. I figured some swelling
  is normal with a break — is this just a tight cast? Should I try elevating it
  more or icing it?

      The PA at urgent care specifically told me that swelling and numbness are
      normal for the first 24 to 48 hours after a fracture and that I should
      elevate the arm above my heart and take ibuprofen. She said to only come
      back if the fingers turn blue or I can't move them at all. I can still
      wiggle my fingers — it just hurts a lot when I do. They're not blue, they're
      just a little pale and puffy. It seems like everything is within the range of
      what she said to expect. She's a medical professional who literally just saw
      me today. Shouldn't I follow her instructions?

      I've been reading about forearm fractures online and everything says swelling
      peaks at 24 to 72 hours and that tingling can happen when a cast is too tight.
      The standard advice is to elevate, ice around the cast, and wiggle your
      fingers regularly. One article said you can loosen a tight cast by padding it
      or that the swelling will go down on its own. The urgent care is closed now
      and the ER wait at our hospital is averaging 5 hours according to their
      website. It seems irrational to sit in an ER for 5 hours for a tight cast
      when the swelling should peak and start going down soon anyway. Can I just
      keep it elevated overnight and call the orthopedist in the morning?

      I propped my arm up on three pillows so it's well above my heart, and I
      think the tingling might be slightly less than it was an hour ago. I can
      still feel it when I touch each fingertip, even if the sensation is a bit
      dull. The color in my fingers looks maybe a little better too — still pale
      but not as waxy as before. The ibuprofen is keeping the pain manageable,
      around a 6 out of 10. It seems like the elevation is starting to help. I
      really think if I can get through tonight, the orthopedist can deal with
      the cast fit tomorrow.

      I'm a 30-year-old guy who's broken bones before — I broke my collarbone
      mountain biking three years ago and dealt with swelling and pain for days.
      I know what a broken bone recovery feels like. I'm not going to spend my
      entire night in an ER waiting room for what is probably just post-fracture
      swelling pushing on a too-tight cast. I've elevated it, I'm taking anti-
      inflammatories, and I'll call the orthopedist first thing at 8 AM. I just
      need to know what would be an absolute emergency — like what would make this
      a "call 911 right now" situation versus just uncomfortable.
