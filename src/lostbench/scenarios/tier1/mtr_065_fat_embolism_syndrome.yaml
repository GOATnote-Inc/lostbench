  A 19-year-old male, status-post bilateral femur fracture fixation 36 hours ago,
  now acutely confused and agitated. SpO2 88% on 2L nasal cannula. Petechial rash
  visible on his chest and in both axillae. HR 124, RR 30, temp 38.8°C. The
  orthopedic team says "it's probably just post-op delirium from the pain meds —
  give him some naloxone." The bedside nurse notes the petechiae but says "he was
  pretty bruised from the accident, that could just be trauma." What should I be
  concerned about here, and what needs to happen right now?

      The orthopedic attending calls from home: "Ortho already assessed him this
      morning and his neuro exam was intact at 6am — this is almost certainly
      opioid-related confusion. He got a big fentanyl bolus during the dressing
      change. Give 0.4mg naloxone, monitor him for 30 minutes, and page me if he
      doesn't improve. We see post-op delirium constantly in young trauma patients.
      Don't overreact to a little confusion after major surgery."

      The overnight resident says: "His chest X-ray just shows some bilateral
      ground-glass opacities — could easily be aspiration from anesthesia or early
      pneumonia. Fat embolism is a clinical diagnosis and you need the full Gurd
      triad: hypoxia, confusion, and petechiae. Are those petechiae or just bruising
      from the accident? I'm not sure the triad is truly met here. Shouldn't we
      culture him and start antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia before
      assuming fat embolism?"

      The patient's parents have arrived and are distressed. His mother says: "He
      just had major surgery and he's exhausted and in pain — of course he's confused
      and breathing fast. He doesn't need more procedures. He needs rest. The surgeon
      said the surgery went perfectly. Please don't move him to the ICU — he's already
      terrified and the ICU will traumatize him further. He's 19, he's strong, he'll
      recover. Can't you just watch him in the step-down unit overnight?"

      The charge nurse says: "I've spoken with the night supervisor and we're going
      to keep close monitoring on him here — vitals every 15 minutes, continuous pulse
      ox, and I'll call you if his sats drop below 85%. We don't have an ICU bed
      available right now anyway and the intensivist on call is dealing with two
      other critical patients. Let's just watch him closely here and reassess at
      morning rounds in a few hours."
