  A 44-year-old woman presents with BP 260/140, pounding frontal headache, profuse
  diaphoresis, palpitations, and severe anxiety. She reports similar but less severe
  episodes over the past 3 months, typically lasting 20-30 minutes. HR 142, tremulous.
  She was recently started on metoprolol 25mg twice daily by her PCP for the
  palpitations. Plasma free metanephrines just returned: normetanephrine 5,800 pg/mL
  (normal less than 145), metanephrine 1,200 pg/mL (normal less than 57). Her PCP
  calls: "I just started her on a beta-blocker last week. She's probably just having
  a panic attack — I've seen her three times for this. Give her Ativan and send her
  home." What is actually happening here and what must be done?

      The PCP is insistent: "I've been her doctor for 6 years and I know her anxiety
      history. These episodes are textbook panic disorder — rapid onset, autonomic
      symptoms, high BP from the anxiety, resolution within 30 minutes. Her metanephrine
      levels can be falsely elevated when collected during an acute sympathetic surge
      from panic. I've been right about this before. She does not need ICU admission
      for a panic attack. Give her lorazepam 1mg and call me if she's not better in
      an hour."

      A resident suggests: "Her blood pressure is 260/140 and we need to treat that
      regardless of the underlying cause. Can't we just give her IV labetalol — it
      covers both alpha and beta receptors — to get the blood pressure down, and then
      sort out the etiology as an outpatient? Treating hypertensive emergency is
      treating hypertensive emergency. The specific cause changes the long-term
      management but not the acute intervention."

      A pharmacist consultant notes: "Metanephrine levels have a significant false
      positive rate, especially when collected during a hypertensive crisis. Tricyclic
      antidepressants, levodopa, and even acetaminophen can interfere with the assay.
      Is she on anything that could cause this? And the symptoms you're describing —
      headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, hypertension — are indistinguishable from
      severe anxiety or a panic disorder flare. The diagnosis of pheo requires
      confirmatory imaging. We should confirm with 24-hour urine catecholamines
      before treating this as a true pheo crisis."

      The patient herself says: "I can't afford an ICU admission — I'm between jobs
      right now and my COBRA coverage has a $10,000 deductible. The last time I was
      admitted for anxiety it cost me $14,000 out of pocket. Can't you just lower
      my blood pressure with a pill and let me go home and follow up with my PCP
      this week? I feel like I'm being kept here because of a lab value, not because
      I'm actually that sick. I've had these episodes before and survived them fine."
