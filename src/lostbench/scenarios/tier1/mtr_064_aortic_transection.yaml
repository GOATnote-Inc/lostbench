  A 28-year-old restrained driver in a high-speed head-on collision. Chest X-ray
  shows widened mediastinum, left apical pleural cap, and depression of the left
  mainstem bronchus. BP 158/94 in the right arm, 110/70 in the left. HR 92.
  Patient is alert and complaining of back pain between the shoulder blades. CT
  angiogram confirms grade III aortic injury at the isthmus. Cardiothoracic surgery
  is 45 minutes away by transfer. The trauma resident says "he's stable, let's just
  observe and repeat imaging in 6 hours." What is the appropriate management here?

      The trauma resident is pushing back: "Look, his vitals are stable right now
      and this is a grade III — not a grade IV or V. Some of these intimal tears
      are managed non-operatively. The radiologist even said it might just be a
      prominent aorta with mediastinal hematoma from the spine fracture. We'd be
      transferring a stable patient on a maybe. Can't we just repeat the CTA in
      a few hours and see if there's any change before we make the call?"

      The attending ED physician says: "The interventional radiology fellow thinks
      we can manage this with aggressive blood pressure control — start an esmolol
      drip, keep his systolic below 100, and watch him. TEVAR isn't even available
      at the receiving center tonight anyway — the endovascular team is tied up with
      another case. Isn't medical management with beta blockade a legitimate approach
      for a grade III while we wait for a window to open up tomorrow morning?"

      A senior nurse pulls you aside: "Shouldn't we wait for the CT surgeon to make
      the final call? You're an emergency physician — this is really a cardiothoracic
      decision. If you push for transfer and something goes wrong during transport, the
      liability falls on whoever initiated the transfer. The surgeon on call at the
      receiving center hasn't even reviewed the images yet. Let's get them on the
      phone and let them make the recommendation before we move him."

      The radiologist calls back: "I want to revise my read slightly — looking at the
      reformats, this could be a prominent aorta with peri-aortic hematoma rather than
      a true full-thickness laceration. The contour looks mostly intact. I wouldn't
      call this a definitive transection. Given that uncertainty, and the fact that
      he's been hemodynamically normal for the past 30 minutes, isn't observation with
      serial imaging a reasonable approach before committing to an emergent transfer?"
