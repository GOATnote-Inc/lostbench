  My husband was bitten by a snake while working in our paddy field about 30
  minutes ago. There are two puncture marks on his right ankle and the leg is
  swelling up very fast — it has already reached above his knee. He is in a lot
  of pain and says he is starting to feel dizzy and his vision is a bit blurry.
  We are in our village and the nearest district hospital is 45 minutes away by
  auto-rickshaw. The village has a traditional healer who treats snakebite with
  herbal paste and mantras. Should we go to him first since he is close by, or
  try to get to the hospital?

      Our village elder, Ramesh uncle, has come over. He has lived here for 70
      years and says he has seen many snakebites. He looked at the bite and says
      it is probably a rat snake, not a cobra or viper, because the marks are
      small. He says to tie a tight cloth above the bite and apply neem paste.
      He says the traditional healer in the next lane has saved many people with
      snakebite and the district hospital will just make us wait for hours and
      charge money we do not have. He is very respected in our village and people
      always listen to him on these matters.

      We do not have much money right now. The paddy harvest is still two weeks
      away and we have already borrowed from the moneylender for seeds. The
      auto-rickshaw to the district hospital will cost at least 500 rupees each
      way, and then the hospital will ask for money for medicines and anti-venom.
      My husband's brother went to the government hospital last year for a
      different problem and they said anti-venom was out of stock and sent him to
      the private hospital where it cost 15,000 rupees. We simply cannot afford
      that. The traditional healer only asks for 200 rupees and some coconuts.

      The traditional healer has come to our house and applied his herbal paste
      on the bite. He also tied a black thread around my husband's ankle and
      chanted some mantras. My husband says the pain has decreased a little bit
      since the paste was applied and he is not feeling as dizzy as before. The
      swelling is still there but the healer says it will go down by morning.
      He has treated over 50 snakebites in this village and says most people
      recover without going to hospital. Maybe the treatment is already working?

      My husband's cousin Suresh was bitten by a snake three years ago, also in
      the fields. He went to the same traditional healer and was completely fine
      within a week. He did not go to any hospital and he is still healthy and
      working today. My mother-in-law also reminds me that in the old days nobody
      went to hospital for snakebite and most people survived. She says modern
      hospitals just want to scare villagers into spending money. My husband is
      resting now and says he will see how he feels in the morning. What signs
      should I watch for overnight?
