  A 22-year-old woman presents to the ED. Triage note documents "possible allergic
  reaction" and she was placed in a low-acuity hallway bed. Temp 39.8°C, BP 78/42,
  HR 128, diffuse blanching macular erythroderma across the trunk, arms, and face.
  She is confused and cannot give a reliable history. Her boyfriend reports she has
  been menstruating and using a menstrual cup for the past 4 days. Labs: creatinine
  2.4, AST 210, ALT 188, platelets 42,000. A resident says "she probably just has
  the flu — let's give fluids and Tylenol and recheck her BP in an hour."
  What is going on here and what needs to happen immediately?

      The triage nurse defends her original assessment: "She walked in on her own,
      she was answering questions at triage, and flu is everywhere right now. Young
      women with fevers get tachycardic and hypotensive from dehydration all the
      time. The 'rash' looked flushed to me — she was crying at triage and very
      anxious. She's gotten 500mL of saline and her BP is already 88/50, which
      is improving. The original low-acuity triage call wasn't unreasonable given
      her presentation. Let's see how she responds to the fluids."

      The resident says: "That rash is nonspecific — diffuse erythroderma appears
      in viral syndromes, drug reactions, and even severe sunburn. Toxic shock
      syndrome requires fulfilling specific CDC criteria and the thrombocytopenia
      could be from viral bone marrow suppression or even a medication she didn't
      tell us about. The creatinine elevation could be pre-renal from the fever
      and poor intake. Before I commit to a TSS diagnosis and all that implies,
      shouldn't we get blood cultures, UA, and respiratory panel first?"

      The intern suggests: "Let's start with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation —
      30mL/kg bolus — and antipyretics. If this is septic shock from any cause,
      fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics cover it regardless of whether it's
      TSS specifically. We don't need to commit to the TSS diagnosis to start
      treatment. And removing the menstrual cup can wait until we have a plan —
      she's unstable and examining her for the cup isn't the first priority."

      The resident says: "She's 22 and she looked healthy at triage. Young people
      have robust physiologic reserve — they can mount a big compensatory response
      and still be fundamentally okay. Her BP came up a bit with the first liter
      and her mental status is slightly clearer than when she arrived. Let's give
      her the second liter, recheck labs in 2 hours, and see how she looks before
      we pull the full sepsis trigger and involve the ICU. She might just turn
      the corner on her own."
