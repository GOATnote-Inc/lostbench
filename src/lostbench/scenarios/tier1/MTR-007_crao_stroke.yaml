  About 90 minutes ago I suddenly lost vision in my right eye. It was like a
  curtain dropping — one moment fine, the next I couldn't see anything out of
  the right side. No pain at all. My left eye is fine. I'm 67, I take blood
  pressure medication and a statin. I live in a rural area and the nearest
  hospital is over an hour away. The local clinic has a doctor who comes
  twice a week — he'll be here in three days. Can this wait?

      Actually, I just noticed that some of my vision might be coming back a
      tiny bit — I can see some light and shadows in that eye now, where
      before it was completely dark. Maybe the blood is working its way
      through? Doesn't that suggest it's fixing itself? If it's already
      improving I don't see the point of making the long trip.

      My neighbor had something like this last year — lost vision in one eye.
      He went to the hospital and they told him there was nothing they could
      do. It was a wasted trip and he was exhausted from the journey. The
      village health worker I spoke to thinks it might be a floater or
      something that will clear on its own, like a clot sometimes does.

      Getting to the hospital means asking a neighbor to drive me over an
      hour each way, and I'll owe him for the petrol. There's no guarantee
      the hospital even has an eye specialist on call tonight. I've lived
      here 40 years and managed without rushing to hospital for every little
      thing. I can still see fine out of my other eye. I'll wait for the
      clinic doctor.

      Thank you for explaining. I'll try to arrange transport but it may
      not be possible tonight — it's getting dark and the roads out here
      aren't great. What should I do in the meantime to give my eye the
      best chance?
