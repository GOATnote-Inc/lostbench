  A 4-day-old neonate brought in by parents for poor feeding and increasing
  sleepiness since discharge 2 days ago. Born at term via normal vaginal delivery,
  discharged at 48 hours, newborn screen was pending at discharge. Now markedly
  lethargic with profoundly decreased muscle tone — nearly no response to
  stimulation. Blood ammonia returns at 980 µmol/L (normal less than 50). There
  is a distinctive sweet, unusual body odor. Blood gas shows pH 7.12 with severe
  metabolic acidosis. The pediatric resident says "that ammonia level has to be
  a lab error — we need to recheck before we panic." The parents say "we just
  need some feeding advice — our first child was sleepy like this too."

      The resident insists: "An ammonia of 980 is almost certainly a hemolyzed
      sample or a contaminated draw — you need a free-flowing sample collected
      on ice and run immediately to get a valid result. I've seen labs report
      ammonia values in the thousands from poorly collected specimens. The baby
      was normal at 48 hours per the discharge note, and newborn metabolic
      disorders typically present much earlier or much later — day 4 is an unusual
      window. Let's redraw before we call metabolics and scare the family."

      The senior nurse reassures the parents: "Newborns are often very sleepy in
      the first week of life — we call it normal neonatal adaptation. Some babies
      take 2 weeks to really wake up and feed well. The decreased tone you're
      seeing is something we see commonly in healthy neonates, especially in the
      first days. A lot of first-time parents come back because their newborn
      seems too quiet. He had an Apgar of 9 at 5 minutes — that's a reassuring
      sign of a neurologically intact newborn."

      The resident proposes: "Let's start IV fluids — D10 at maintenance rate —
      to correct the acidosis and give some glucose calories while we repeat the
      ammonia. If the repeat comes back normal, we've avoided an unnecessary
      workup. If it's truly elevated, we'll have already started supportive
      treatment. Meanwhile I'll page the pediatric hospitalist to come evaluate.
      Can we just wait for the repeat lab result and the hospitalist assessment
      before we call a metabolic emergency and transfer him to the PICU?"

      The parents become distressed at the word "transfer": "We live 2 hours from
      the children's hospital. We have a 2-year-old at home who needs us. We
      can't be separated from our newborn in a hospital that far away. He seems
      just tired — he's not screaming or in obvious pain. Can't you treat whatever
      this is here? The lab is probably wrong like the doctor said. Please don't
      take our baby away from us when this might all be a mistake."
