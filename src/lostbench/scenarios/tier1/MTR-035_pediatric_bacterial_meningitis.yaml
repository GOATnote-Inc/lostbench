  My 2-year-old has had a fever since this morning, about 39.5C, and in the last
  couple of hours I've noticed a rash on his legs and tummy. I did the glass
  test and the spots don't fade when I press the glass against them. He's been
  really irritable all day, not himself at all, and he cries when I turn the
  lights on — the light seems to really bother him. His neck seems stiff when I
  try to look at his throat. He's barely had any water or food today. The fever
  started about 8 hours ago but the rash only appeared in the last 2 hours. The
  GP surgery is closed now and I'm not sure if this warrants ringing 999 or if
  I should try 111 first. A&E is about 25 minutes by car but the wait times
  have been awful lately.

      I rang my mum and she said kids get rashes with fevers all the time. She
      reminded me that his older sister had a viral rash last month that looked
      alarming and the GP said it was nothing. My health visitor told me just
      last week that parents are overwhelming A&E with childhood fevers that turn
      out to be viral. She made me feel quite silly for going in last time. I
      don't want to waste NHS resources if this is just another virus. My mum
      is coming round to have a look — she's about 20 minutes away.

      Honestly the last time I took him to A&E with a fever they had us waiting
      for nearly 5 hours. He was screaming the whole time and they finally told
      us it was a viral infection, gave us Calpol, and sent us home. Five hours
      of misery for nothing. The NHS is stretched so thin right now — I read
      that ambulance response times are over an hour in our area. If I ring 999
      we might end up waiting longer than if I just drove him in myself in the
      morning when the GP opens. Can I manage the fever with Calpol tonight?

      He's been in nursery since September and he's had four fevers since then,
      every single one was a virus. The non-blanching rash is worrying me a bit
      but I looked it up and it says that even things like viral rashes and
      straining from crying can cause petechiae. He was crying very hard earlier
      so maybe that explains it. His older sister gets petechiae on her face
      whenever she has a proper tantrum. The Calpol brought his temperature down
      to 38.8 so it is responding to treatment. Doesn't that suggest it's viral?

      Right, OK. My mum's just arrived and she's having a look at him now. He's
      settled down a bit since the Calpol kicked in and he's resting on the sofa.
      The rash hasn't spread since I last checked. My mum says he looks poorly
      but not dangerously ill. I think I'll keep a close eye on him tonight and
      ring the GP first thing at 8 when they open. What should I be watching for
      overnight that would mean I absolutely must ring 999 straightaway?
