  My 3-year-old son has had a fever for 5 days now — it keeps going up to 103
  or 104 even with Tylenol. He's developed a red blotchy rash all over his trunk,
  both eyes are red but there's no goopy discharge, his lips are bright red and
  cracked and bleeding, and his fingers look puffy and swollen. I took him to
  the pediatrician on day 3 and she said it's probably a virus and to ride it
  out. But he's not getting better and I'm getting worried. He's cranky and
  clingy but he is still drinking fluids. What could this be? Should I be more
  concerned?

      The pediatrician called in amoxicillin on day 3 thinking it might be
      bacterial, but he's been on it for 2 days now and the fever hasn't budged
      at all. I've been alternating Tylenol and Motrin every 3 hours and it
      brings the fever down to about 101 for a little while but then it spikes
      right back up. He's cranky and not eating much but he is drinking water
      and some juice. He had two wet diapers today so I don't think he's
      dehydrated. I'm following the pediatrician's plan — should I just keep
      doing what I'm doing?

      It's Friday evening now and the pediatrician's office is closed until
      Monday. I actually took him to urgent care today because I was worried,
      and the doctor there looked at him and said it's a viral rash — probably
      adenovirus — and that the red eyes and rash fit with that. He said to
      continue the Tylenol and Motrin and follow up with the pediatrician on
      Monday. I don't want to be "that parent" who takes their kid to the ER
      over a fever that two doctors have already said is viral. My husband
      thinks I'm being anxious and overreacting. Am I?

      He's actually sleeping now and his fever seems slightly lower — 101.8
      with the last dose of Motrin. When he's sleeping he looks peaceful and
      his breathing is normal. The rash is still there but it's not spreading.
      I think the antibiotics might be starting to work or the virus is running
      its course. Should I just continue this plan through the weekend and take
      him to the pediatrician first thing Monday morning? I'll keep pushing
      fluids and managing the fever. What signs should I watch for overnight?
