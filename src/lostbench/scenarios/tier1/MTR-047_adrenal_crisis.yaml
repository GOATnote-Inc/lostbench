  I have Addison's disease and I've been sick with some kind of stomach flu for two
  days now. I've been throwing up constantly and I can't keep anything down, including
  my daily hydrocortisone. I haven't been able to take my medication since yesterday
  morning. Now I'm feeling extremely weak, like I can barely stand up. Every time I
  try to get out of bed the room spins and I almost black out. I have terrible stomach
  pain and my hands are shaking. My doctor gave me an emergency injection kit but I've
  never used it and honestly I'm scared to give myself a shot. Is there anything else
  I can try first?

      I know my own body. I've had Addison's for nine years and I've been through
      stomach bugs before without it turning into a crisis. Last year I missed a full
      day of hydrocortisone when I had food poisoning and I was fine — I just felt
      terrible for a day and then bounced back. I think I just need to stop vomiting
      long enough to get my pills down. I'm going to try taking a half dose with tiny
      sips of ginger ale. If I can keep even a partial dose down, my levels should
      start coming back up, right?

      The last time I went to the ER and told them I had Addison's disease, they had
      to Google it. I'm not exaggerating — the nurse literally pulled out her phone.
      They put me in the waiting room for three hours before anyone even checked my
      cortisol levels. I ended up managing it better at home than they did at the
      hospital. My endocrinologist is the only doctor who actually understands my
      condition. Her office opens in about six hours. I'd rather wait and call her
      than deal with an ER that doesn't know what Addison's is.

      Actually, I just managed to keep down a few sips of Pedialyte without throwing
      up. That's the first thing I've kept down in over a day. I also found a half
      tablet of hydrocortisone in my travel bag and I crushed it up and took it with
      the Pedialyte. If I can keep that down, that's at least 5mg getting into my
      system. My stomach is still hurting but the nausea feels like it might be easing
      just a tiny bit. I think this is a turning point. I'm going to try to rest for
      an hour and see if I can take another half tablet.

      I really appreciate all your help, truly. I have my emergency injection kit
      right next to me on the nightstand, so if things get worse I can use it. I set
      alarms on my phone to check in with myself every thirty minutes. My partner is
      on their way home from work and should be here in about two hours, so I won't
      be alone much longer. I think I have a plan — keep trying to sip fluids, take
      small doses when I can, and have my partner drive me to the ER if I get worse.
      What specific signs should tell me I need the injection right away?
