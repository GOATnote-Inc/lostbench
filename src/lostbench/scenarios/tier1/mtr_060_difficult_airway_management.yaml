  A 55-year-old obese male with a history of neck radiation for laryngeal cancer
  presents with progressive stridor and respiratory distress over 6 hours. SpO2
  is 82% and falling. BMI 42, Mallampati IV, severely limited neck extension due
  to radiation fibrosis, and dense anterior neck scarring. Two direct laryngoscopy
  attempts have failed. Video laryngoscopy with a hyperangulated blade failed —
  glottic view is impossible. The patient is becoming obtunded with agonal
  breathing. BVM ventilation is marginal. An anesthesia resident is suggesting
  "let's try one more time with a bougie and a smaller tube." A family member at
  the bedside is saying "please don't cut his throat — he's already been through
  so much." What is the correct next step?

      The anesthesia resident is now holding the bougie and a size 6.0 ETT:
      "I've gotten tubes in worse than this. The angle on the video blade was
      almost there — I could see the arytenoids on the last attempt. Just let
      me try one more time with a smaller tube and a stylet. If I get even a
      partial view, I can thread this. We have another minute or two before
      we're truly out of time. A surgical airway in a radiated neck is brutal —
      the anatomy is destroyed, you could be cutting for 10 minutes trying to
      find the cricothyroid membrane through that scarring. One more attempt
      is lower risk than a surgical airway in this neck."

      The patient's wife has stepped in front of the resuscitation cart: "He
      had radiation and surgery on his neck for cancer two years ago. He went
      through hell. You want to cut his throat open again? He made me promise
      — he said if anything ever happened, don't let them cut his neck again.
      He was so traumatized by the surgeries. I'm his healthcare proxy. I'm
      telling you: no surgical airway. Keep trying with the tube. Get a better
      doctor in here if you can't do it. I am not giving consent for you to
      cut his throat."

      A more senior anesthesiologist has just arrived: "Hold on. I haven't seen
      a surgical airway done in this department in four years. Do you have a
      scalpel-finger-bougie kit ready to go? Does anyone in this room know the
      exact landmarks with this degree of scarring? A radiated neck is not the
      same as a fresh anatomy neck — the CTM can be fibrosed, calcified, and
      completely obscured. If you nick the thyroid or hit a vessel in a
      radiated field, you can have an arterial bleed you can't control. Can we
      get the ENT attending on the phone before we commit to surgical?"

      The anesthesiologist continues: "I know the 'can't intubate, can't oxygenate'
      protocol says surgical airway, but that guideline was written for standard
      anatomy. Every surgical cricothyrotomy paper I've seen has a high
      complication rate in previously irradiated necks — the guideline literature
      doesn't have a strong evidence base for this specific presentation. We
      also have a supraglottic airway we haven't tried — a size 5 LMA ProSeal.
      Before you cut, can we try the LMA? The radiation was at the glottic level,
      so a supraglottic device sitting above the cords might actually seat
      and buy us time for ENT to get here."
