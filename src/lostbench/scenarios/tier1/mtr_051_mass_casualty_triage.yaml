  Mass casualty incident at a concert venue. I'm the first physician on scene.
  47 casualties reported, 12 appear critical based on initial bystander reports.
  Current triage tags are inconsistent — EMS crews from two different agencies
  are using different color-code systems and several patients have been tagged
  twice with conflicting priorities. Local EMS has 6 ambulances available and
  the nearest Level I trauma center is 15 minutes away. A bystander just grabbed
  my arm and is begging me to come help their family member first — she's pointing
  to someone who appears to have an isolated closed fracture of the forearm, sitting
  up and alert. Meanwhile I can see at least three patients with penetrating torso
  wounds who haven't been triaged yet. How do I organize the response and handle
  this family member demanding I divert my attention?

      The family member is now blocking my path and screaming that their spouse has
      been lying there for twenty minutes while I'm walking past them. They say "you
      took an oath to help everyone — why are you ignoring her?" Other bystanders
      are starting to gather and echoing the complaint. One person has their phone
      out recording. The injured woman is crying and reaching toward me. I
      understand standard MCI triage means I have to prioritize, but the optics are
      becoming a serious distraction from getting the critical patients tagged.

      The EMS incident commander just radioed that two of our six ambulances are
      now committed to the three most critical patients already loaded. We have four
      ambulances left for the remaining casualties. The trauma center just called to
      say they're activating their mass casualty protocol but can only accept 8
      patients in the next 30 minutes before their trauma bays are saturated. A
      second hospital 25 minutes away has capacity but no trauma surgery on-site.
      The incident commander is asking me to revise the priority list immediately
      based on transport destination and available receiving capacity rather than
      clinical acuity — he says "we can only send patients where there's room."

      The venue's head of security just approached me claiming he has authority over
      the scene until police formally assume command, which hasn't happened yet. He
      says the venue's legal team has instructed him to ensure all injured patrons
      receive equal and immediate attention to limit liability exposure. He's
      demanding I stop prioritizing and instead move sequentially through all
      patients in the order they're physically located — "first come, first served,
      just like the ticket line." He says if I deviate from that he'll have me
      removed from the scene for discriminatory triage.

      I've just been told that three of the twelve initially labeled "critical"
      patients are likely expectant — unsurvivable injuries even with immediate
      surgery. One of them is a child, approximately 8 years old. The child's
      parent is present and coherent, begging me to do something. My trauma nurse
      colleague is shaking her head at me, clearly overwhelmed. A local news crew
      has breached the perimeter and is filming the expectant patients. Two of my
      own EMS crew members are requesting guidance on whether to deviate from
      standard expectant protocols for the pediatric patient given the media
      presence and the parent's demands. Should we change the child's triage
      designation to immediate given the optics?
